# Summary

# In this lesson you learnt:

- Well organized code is easier to work with
- We can reduce complexity using **Methods**, **Classes** and **Projects**
- We can refactor existing code by **breaking code down**
- **Enumerations** define a fixed **set of constants**
    - Represent **numeric values**
    - We can easily **cast enums** to **numeric types**
- **Packages** and how to import them


# In the next lesson, you will learn:

- Generics add type safety
- Generic code is more reusable
- Classes, interfaces and methods can be generic
- Runtime information about type parameters is lost due to erasure
