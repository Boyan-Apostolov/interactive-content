A programming language is an **artificial language** for issuing commands that we want the computer to **read**, **process** and **execute**. 

Using programming languages, we can write **sequences of commands** (programs), which define what the computer should do. 

Some of the **most popular** programming languages currently are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go. 

These languages **differ in their philosophy**, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**. 

## Compilers 

The compiler **translates** the **code** from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, **previously prepared** fragment of machine code and in the meantime it checks the text of the program for errors. 

Together, all compiled into machine code fragments represent the program in a way which the microprocessor of the computer can process it. 

## Interpreters 

The interpreter is `a program for executing programs`. 

It **executes the commands** in the program one after another, as it is able to process not only a single command or a sequence of commands, but also **other language constructions.**

JavaScript is **prototype-based**, **multi-paradigm**, **dynamic language**. 

It is used both on the **client-side** (in the Web browser) but also on the **server-side** (in Node.js). 

The demand for JavaScript developers is currently among the highest. 

This ensures professional realization once you have the skills you need! 

It is used by about **10,7 million programmers around the world** (according to SlashData).

JavaScript is one of the most **suitable** programming languages for **beginners**.

It is also **easy to learn** JavaScript through the great set of video tutorials and exercises at SoftUni. 

Supports **imperative**, **functional** and **object-oriented** programming with a clear and concise syntax.

As we have already mentioned, a program is a **sequence of commands**. 
Otherwise said, it contains a sequence of **calculations**, **evaluations**, **iterations**, and all kinds of similar operations, which **aim to obtain a certain result**. 

A JavaScript program is written in the **form of text**, and the text of the program is called **source code**. 

The **interpreter** executes the code **directly line by line**. 

Scripts and interpreted languages, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, **get their name** from the fact that their source code gets **executed step by step by an interpreter.**

The process of **compiling** the code before its execution is used only in **compiled languages** like C#, Java and C++.
