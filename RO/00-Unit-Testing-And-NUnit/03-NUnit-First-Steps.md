**NUnit** is an open source **C#** test framework.

Similarly to **JUnit**, **NUnit** has a graphical user interface.

We can run tests continuosly and the results will be provided immediatelly.

**NUnit** has a built-in support for **Visual Studio**.

Lets see how to create a blank project in Visual Studio.

# Creating a Blank Solution

Opening a new Visual Studio tab we are going to create a "new project".

We can type "**blank solution**" in the template search block.

Blank solution is an empty solution that does not contain any project inside.

We can imagine the "blank solution" as a package that will hold our project inside.

After we have created a blank solution we can right click on the newly created solution and press **Add** -> **New project**

We choose at **Console Application** and the appropriate name for it.

In this case we will name our solution **Summator**.
