Unit testing frameworks execute the tests and generate reports.

When developers use the testing frameworks:
- When they want to **organize** them in a hierarchy using classes and functions
- In need to **assert** the execution results and exit conditions for correctness
- To handle some specific situations (like "**expected error**" or "**expected timeout**") and to **automate** some aspects of the testing process
(like initializing the testing environment at startup and cleaning it up at shutdown).

**Examples** of unit testing frameworks are:

- **Mocha** testing framework for JavaScript
- **JUnit** framework for Java
- **xUnit** framework for C#
- **Chai** framework for ReactJS and many more...
