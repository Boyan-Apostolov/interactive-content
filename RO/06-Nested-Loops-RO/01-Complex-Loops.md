When using for-loops, the loop variable can be modified in more than one way.

In addition to incrementation and decrementation, it can be altered using more complex logic, such as division and multiplication.

For example:
``` java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
    System.out.println(i);
    // Print only even values of i from 0 to 10
}

for (int i = 20; i > 0; i -= 5) {
     System.out.println(i);
    // Print values that are devisible by 5
}

for (int j = 2; j <= 16; j *= 2) {
    System.out.println(j);
    // Print the results of powers of 2 ascending
}

for (int j = 16; j > 1; j /= 2) {
    System.out.println(j);
    // Print the results of powers of 2 descending
}

```
