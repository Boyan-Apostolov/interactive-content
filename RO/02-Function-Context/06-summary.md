# Summary

**In this lesson we learned:**
- **Functional Context** - the object from which the code originated is its default context. 

- What **this** refers to depends on **where** and **how** the **function** that is being executed **is called**.

- The functions **bind**, **apply** and **call** that can all be used to explicitly set the value of **this**.

- **Internal** Object Properties that allow you to modify how the object properties will behave: 
  - **enumerable**, **configurable** and **writable**;
  - **seal** and **freeze** that deal with the object's **immutability**;


**In this the next lesson we will learn:**
- **Advanced Functions** - what are first-class and higher-order functions.

- **Currying and Partial Application** - function decomposition.

- **Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions** - anonymous functions.

- **Closure** - understanding function scope.

- **Error Handling** - the concept of error handling, types of errors, and throwing exceptions.
