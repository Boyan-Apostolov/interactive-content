In this exercises, we shall **test a real-world project**, not just a single isolated C# class. 

You are given a simple **C# Web application**, based on ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and MS SQL Server database. 

Your task is to write **unit tests** for its **controller classes**. 

You will need to use **mocked database** to simulate the external database dependency.

Open the project in Visual Studio, compile and run it. You need to have the following software installed:

- .NET 5 or later version [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)
- MS SQL Server LocalDB [MS SQL Server LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb)
- Visual Studio 2019 or later version [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
