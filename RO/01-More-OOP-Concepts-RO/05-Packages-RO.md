# Pachete in Java

**Packages** are used to **group related classes.**

You can think of them as **folders** in a file directory.

Use **packages** to **avoid** name **conflicts** and to write **better, maintainable code.**

Packages are divided into **two** main categories:
- **Built-in** packages (packages from the **Java API**)
- **User-defined** packages (custom packages created by the **developer**)

The Java **library** is divided into **packages** and **classes**.

You can import a single class or a whole package that contains all the classes.

- To use a class or a package, use the `import` keyword

```java
import package.name.Class; // Import a single class 
import package.name.*;     // Import the whole package
```
