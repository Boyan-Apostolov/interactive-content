## Software Systems

Software systems consist of **interconnected components** organized in a certain structure called **architecture**.

- **Software architecture** is a broad engineering discipline
- In large organizations, the architecture is designed by **software architects**
- In smaller organizations, the architecture is designed by the **senior developers** or by the technical **team leader**
- The **software architecture** defines the **structure** of the system: its **components** and their **interactions**

Concepts related to **software architectures** are:
- **Monolith apps** â€“ applications, consisting of a single component
- The **"client-server" model**, where the client requests resources from the server and displays them to the user
- The concept of **"front-end"** (the user interface of the system) and **"back-end"** (the data storage and processing logic)
- The classical **"3-tier"** and **"multi-tier"** architectural models, where the system is split into the user **interface**, **business logic**, and **data storage**
- The concept of **"SOA"** (service-oriented architecture) and **microservices** (self-contained software components)
- All these concepts are complicated, and developers learn them in detail as they gain experience for many years
- At **SoftUni** we shall **review only some of these concepts** because junior developers should be familiar with them

# The "Client-Server" Model

The **client-server** architectural model is widely used in modern apps. **Web sites**, **games**, **information systems**, **business software** are just few examples of client-server systems.

Unless the architecture is more complex, **if an app is connected to the Internet** and stores data at some server, it is built on a "**client-server**" architecture.

In the **"client-server" architectural model**, the **server** holds the **app data** and the business logic and provides **APIs** to clients to access the server data.

The **clients** implement the **user interface** (the UI) and **consume the server APIs**.

This is how most modern apps like **Facebook** and **YouTube** work:

**The server** holds the **app data**, such as users, chat messages, photos, videos, etc.

**The client** (such as mobile app or Web app) displays the data, stored at the server.

The **server** is responsible for **data storage** and **data processing**.

It holds the **business logic**: who can access the data, which data, who can store new data, etc.

The server **exposes an API** (application programming interface), typically accessible over HTTP, and clients call this API.

The **client** is responsible for the **user interface**: to read the data from the server and display it to the user.

Clients access the server through the Internet or through a local network.

**The data** in the client-server model is **shared**.

This means that several users can work on the same data in the same time.

The server usually implements mechanism to resolve the eventual conflicts when several users change the same data.

Let's look at these few **examples** of client-server systems:

- The first example is when a **Web browser opens a Web site**.
- The **Web browser** is the client software.
- The **Web server**, holding the Web site, is the server software.
- The **app data** stored at the server-side is the Web site itself.
- The **user interface** at the client side is the rendered Web page from the Web site.
- The second **example** is when an **Email client retrieves the email messages from a mail server**.
- The **email client** is the client software. It retrieves and email messages from the server and displays them.
- The **mail server**, holding the users' mailboxes, is the server software.
- The **app data** stored at the server-side are the mailboxes with the mail messages for each user.
- The **user interface** at the client side is the email app (mobile, desktop or Web app).
- The **third example** is when a chat **client communicates with a chat server to display the most recent chat messages for certain user**.
- The **chat client** is the client software. It listens for new messages and displays the chat conversations for the current user.
- The **chat server**, holding the users and their chat conversations, is the server software.
- The **app data** stored at the server-side are the users and their chat conversations, photos, videos, documents, files, etc.
- The **user interface** at the client side is the chat app (mobile, desktop or Web app).
- **The client-server** model is almost everywhere, when we have **connected applications**.

It is an important concept in software development and programmers should understand is well.

At **SoftUni**, we teach the client-server model in many courses in the professional modules related to front-end and back-end development.
