## Software Systems

Software systems consist of **interconnected components** organized in a certain structure called **architecture**.
- **Software architecture** is a broad engineering discipline
- In large organizations, the architecture is designed by **software architects**
- In smaller organizations, the architecture is designed by the **senior developers** or by the technical **team leader**
- The **software architecture** defines the **structure** of the system: its **components** and their **interactions**

Concepts related to **software architectures** are:
- **Monolith apps** â€“ applications, consisting of a single component
- The **"client-server" model**, where the client requests resources from the server and displays them to the user
- The concept of **"front-end"** (the user interface of the system) and **"back-end"** (the data storage and processing logic)
- The classical **"3-tier"** and **"multi-tier"** architectural models, where the system is split into the user interface, business logic, and data storage
- The concept of **"SOA"** (service-oriented architecture) and **microservices** (self-contained software components)
- All these concepts are complicated, and developers learn them in detail as they gain experience for many years
- At **SoftUni** we shall **review only some of these concepts** because junior developers should be familiar with them
