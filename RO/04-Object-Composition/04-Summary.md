# Summary

## In this lesson you learned about:

- Object composition: combines data and functions into "JavaScript" objects.

```js
let student = {
    firstName: 'Maria',
    lastName: 'Green',
    age: 22,
    location: { lat: 52.520, lng: 13.404 }
}
```

- Aggregation: forming an object from an enumerable collection.
- Concatenation: adding new properties.
- Delegation: imitates class inheritance.

## In the next lesson we will learn:

- Inheritance

- Classical Inheritance

- Prototype Chain
