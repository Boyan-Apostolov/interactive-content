# Triple S – SoftUni Stores System

Because of the fact that the students in the Java Track are the best in SoftUni, 

with а look into the future, they decided to create databases for all eventually future businesses of the SoftUni. 

Of course, they have many ideas, but they need to start from somewhere. You have more than year experience, 

that’s why you were chosen for a senior developer for one of the teams. 

Your task is to create a store system – SoftUni Stores System. 

You and the other senior developers create an E/R Diagram, that looks like this. 

Good Luck.
