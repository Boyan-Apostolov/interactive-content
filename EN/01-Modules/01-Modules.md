A **Module** is a **set of functions** that is made **accessible throughout any part of your application**.

Modules are used to **encapsulate** related **code and data** in order to **implement a certain functionality**.

Most often, **modules** are packaged in a **single unit**, so that they are **easier to deploy**.

There are numerous benefits when it comes to using modules:

- **Preventing repetitive code**

- **Grouping related behaviour**, enabling easier access in the future

- Enables **storing** an application's codebase **across multiple files**, thus making code **easier to read** and understand.
  
- **Scope** is easier to control and maintain, because **modules do not populate the global** scope.
  
- **Errors are easier to track down**, because they are **isolated to a smaller portion of the program**.

# Approaches for Modules

There are **three main ways** to create **modules** in your program:

- Using **Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions**\(IIFE\);

- Using Node.js `require` and `export`;

- Using the `import/export` statements:
  
    - Built **directly into JavaScript**;

    - Before the introduction of **ES6** in 2015, modules were not native to JavaScript.
