# What are Modules?

A **Module** is a **set of functions** that is made **accessible throughout any part of your application**.

Modules are used to **encapsulate code and data** to **implement a certain functionality**.

Most often, **modules** are packaged in a **single unit**, so that they are **easier to deploy**.

There are numerous benefits when it comes to using modules:

- **Avoiding code repetition**

- **Grouping related behavior**, enabling easier access in the future

- Enables **storing** an application's codebase **across multiple files**, making code **easier to read** and understand
  
- **Their Scope** is easier to control and maintain because **modules do not populate the global** scope
  
- **Errors are easier to track down** because they are **isolated to a smaller portion of the program**

## Approaches for Modules

There are **three main ways** to create **modules** in your program:

- Using **Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions**\(IIFE\)

- Using Node.js **require** and **export**

- Using the import/export statements
  
    - Built **directly into JavaScript**

    - Before the introduction of **ES6** in 2015, modules were not native to JavaScript
