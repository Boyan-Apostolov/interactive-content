Every web page is an HTML document, which consists of plain text and tags.

Having to work **directly** with text at a large website is a tedious task.

The DOM eases working with HTML by **translating it to objects**, which can easily be manipulated by JavaScript.

DOM is simply a **link** between HTML documents and the JavaScript programming language.

Through DOM manipulations, the developer can:

- Get an HTML element

- Change an element

- Add a new element

- Delete an element

Here is an example of an HTML element:

```js
<p>This is some random text</p>
```

In this example, the element is surrounded by opening and closing tags, specifying its type (in this case - a paragraph).

Between the two tags, there is the text value of the element.

The HTML DOM is an **Object Model** for the HTML document.

It defines:

- HTML elements as objects

- Properties

- Methods

- Events

Here is an example of what the HTML DOM looks like:
