## Description

Write a program that tracks your team's performance at a Christmas charity tournament.

Every day, until the "**Finish**" command you will receive **different type of game names**.

By **winning** each game, you win **20 euro** for charity. 

You need to **calculate how much money** you earned at the end of the day. 

**If you have more games won than lost** - you are the winner of the day and your money gets **increased by 10%**.

At the end of the tournament, if you have been a winner on most days, you win the tournament and **increase all winnings by 20%**.

**You will never have an equal number of won and lost games**.

## Input

**Initially, the number of days of the tournament is read from the console - an integer in the interval \[1â€¦ 20\]**

Until you receive the "**Finish**" command, read:

- Sports - **String**

For each sport read:

  * result - **String with options: "win" or "lose"**


## Output

The output is formatted in one line:

- If you **win** the tournament:

     "You won the tournament! Total money raised: \{earned money\}"

- If you **lost** in the tournament:

"You lost the tournament! Total money raised: \{earned money\}"

**The money variable should be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.**

## Example:

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | 
| **2** | You won the tournament! Total money raised: 132.00 |
| volleyball | |
| win | | 
| football | |
| lose | |
| basketball | |
| win | |
| **Finish** | |
| golf | | 
| win | |
| tennis | |
| win | |
| badminton | |
| win | |
| **Finish** | |


## Comments:

The tournament is 2 days long.

**The first day:**

We play volleyball and win -> 20 Euro.

We play football and lose -> 0 Euro.

We play basketball and win -> 20 Euro.

We get the Finish command and the games for the day are over. 

Earned money 20 + 0 + 20 = 40 Euro We have more games won than lost, respectively we increase the money of the day by 10% -> 44 Euro.

**The Second day:**

We play golf and win -> 20 Euro.

We play tennis and win -> 20 Euro.

We play badminton and win -> 20 Euro.

We receive the **Finish** command and the games for the day are over. 

Earned money 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 Euro We have only won games, respectively we increase the money of the day by 10% -> 66 Euro.

The money earned from the two days: 44 + 66 = 110 Euro.

Since we have more wins than losses, we win the tournament and increase the money by 20% -> 132 Euro.
