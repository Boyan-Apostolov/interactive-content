## Description

Create a program that calculates the **bonus points** for each **student**, for a certain course.

On the first line, you are going to receive **the number of students** for the course.

**On the second line**, you are going to receive **the number of the lectures** in the course.

Every course has **an additional bonus**.

On the third line, you are going to receive the **additional bonus** for the course. 

On the next lines, you will be receiving the **number of attendances for each student**. 

The bonus points are calculated using the following **formula**:

\{total bonus\} = \{student attendances\} \/ \{course lectures\} \* (5 + \{additional bonus\})

Find the student with the **most bonus points** and print his/her **points** along with  **attendances** in the following format:


"**Max Bonus:** \{**maxBonusPoints**\}."
"**The student has attended** \{**studentAttendances**\} **lectures.**"


In the end, round the bonus points up to **the next whole number**.

### Input / Constrains

- On the **first line**, you are going to receive the number of students - an integer in range \[0...50\]

- On the **second line**, you are going to receive the number of lectures - an integer in range \[0...50\]

- On the **third line**, you are going to receive **the initial bonus** - an integer in range \[0...100\]

- **On the next lines**, you will be receiving the number of **attendance of each student**

- There will **not be students with the same final amount bonus points**

### Output

- Print the maximum bonus points, rounded up to the nearest whole number, along with the attendance of the given student, in the format described above 

## Example One
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | Max Bonus: 34. |
| 25 | The student has attended 24 lectures. |
| 30 |  |
| 12 |  |
| 19 |  |
| 24 |  |
| 16 |  |
| 20 |  |

### Comments

First, we receive the **number of students** enrolled in the course - 5.

The total count of the lectures is 25 and the initial bonus is 30.

Then we calculate the bonus of the student with 12 attendances, which is 16.8.

We continue to calculate **each student's bonus points**. 

The one **with** 24 **attendances** has the **highest bonus** - 33.6 (34 **rounded**), so we print the corresponding message to the console.

## Example One
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Max Bonus: 18. |
| 30 | The student has attended 28 lectures. |
| 14 |  |
| 8 |  |
| 23 |  |
| 27 |  |
| 28 |  |
| 15 |  |
| 17 |  |
| 25 |  |
| 26 |  |
| 5 |  |
| 18 |  |
