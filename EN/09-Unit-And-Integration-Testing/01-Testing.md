# Testing

Testing is a phase in the software development life cycle right so when you build software the software should work and should work efficiently and correctly.

So then we should test the software and testing is important.

We have two types of testing:

- **Manual testing:** is testing everything manually so you are taking the outputs you are giving some input
- **Automation testing:** is to write code to automate our testing

In Java j-unit library is used for automation testing.

In different languages, we have defined ways of testing.

We have one more classification of testing which:

- **Functional testing:** it simply means we are testing the code

For example, if we have multiple classes and multiple methods we are testing them so we are testing the actual working on the software.

- **Non-functional testing:** is testing the performance and scalability of the software

An example of good performance is when the software works smoothly and does not give any lag.

When we play a game it should give a proper performance.

When we scale our application and deploy an application on the cloud.

We should not just build software that works but cannot be scaled.

We have two techniques of testing:

- **Black box:**

For example, when we buy a new phone we do not know how this phone works internally.

So what we do is to unlock the phone, test if the camera is working, then test the screen, etc.

What we do is to test the phone outside we do not know what is going on inside, we give the input and expect the output.

- **White box:**

In a white box testing, we do not just test does the phone work, but we open and check each component how does it work.

In coding terms, we will check if the code is correctly written.

There is also four levels of testing:

- **Unit testing:**

In Java we have classes and each class will have certain methods so if we want to test the smallest part of our software which is a class.

So we will test a class and we will call it a unit, we will test each class which is units and this is called **unit testing**.

In Java, if we want to achieve that we have JUnit.

- **Integration testing:**

When we test each component we could combine all the components to test them as software which is **integration testing**.

Integration testing is when we combine a lot of different classes and test them as a whole.

- **System testing:**

When we do unit testing and integration testing we could combine them and do **system testing**.

If our system is deployed and how that works with other software and with the actual data.

- **Acceptance testing:** is when we match our software with the client's requirement

We have a business requirement and we will try to match them with our application's logic.
