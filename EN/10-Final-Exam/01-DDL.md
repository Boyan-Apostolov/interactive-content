# Database Overview

You have been given an Entity / Relationship Diagram of the **SoftUni Stores System**

[image assetsSrc="Exam.png" /]


The **SoftUniStoresSystem** needs to hold information about **stores, products, employees, addresses, towns, pictures and categories**.

Your task is to create a database called **softuni_stores_system**. Then you will have to create several **tables**.

-	**stores** – contains information about the **stores**.
    -	**Each store has a name, rating, has parking and relation with addresses**.

-	**products** – contains information about the **products**.
    -	**Each product has a name, best before, price, description** and has 
        relations with **categories** and **pictures**.

-	**products_stores** – a **many** to **many mapping** table between the **products** and the **stores**.
    -	Has a **composite primary key** from **product_id** and **store_id** 

-	**employees** – contains information about the **employees**.
    -	**Each employee has first name, middle name, last name, salary and have relations with stores and with self**.

-	**addresses** – contains information about the **addresses** of stores.
    -	Each **address has name and relation with towns**.

-	**towns** - contains information about the **towns**.
    -	**Each town has a name**.

-	**categories** – contains information about the **categories**.
    -	**Each category has a name**.

-	**pictures** – contains information about the **pictures**.
    -	**Each picture has a name and date and time when is added on**.
