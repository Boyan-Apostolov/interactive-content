## In this lesson, you learned:

- What is Inheritance:

    - **inheritance** is the ability of a class to copy the functions of another class

    - the class that inherits is called **Child** and the inherited one is called **Parent**

- Objects have an **internal property** used for implementing **prototype-based inheritance**

    - **methods** and **properties** are inherited by reference

- The **properties** in the **prototype chain** form a **hierarchical chain**

- There are two ways to create an object

  - **literal creation**

```js
let Greet = {
    greet: 'Hi!',
    print: function() {
        console.log(this.greet);
    },
};
```

  - **Constructor creation**

```js 
 function Greet() {
    this.greet = 'Hi!';
    this.print = function() {
        return `${this.greet}`;
    };
}

let greet = new Greet();  
```
