# Angular Project Assignment

Your task is to **design** and **implement** a web application using Angular. 

You can either use a service like Firebase for your **back-end**, create your own with Node.js and MongoDB, or a framework in another language (ASP.NET, Spring, Symfony). 

Your project can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application of your choice.

## Application Structure

The application should have:
- Public part (accessible without authentication)
- Private part (available only for registered users)

### Public Part
The public part of your projects should be visible **without authentication**. 

This public part could be the application start page, the user login, and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (User Area)

Registered users should have a personal area in the web application **accessible after successful login**. 

This area could hold, for example, the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo-sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

## General Requirements

Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks, and development techniques:

- At least 3 different **dynamic pages** (pages like about, contacts, login, register are not considered dynamic)

If your project **does not cover** this condition you will not be graded.

- Use Angular for the client-side

- Communicate to a **remote service** (via REST, sockets, GraphQL, or a similar client-server technique)

- Implement **authentication**

- Use a **source control system** like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.

Commit inside the repository for at least 3 days.

## Other Requirements

- Apply **error handling** and **data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered

- Brief **documentation** on the project and project architecture (as .md file)

- Good usability

Good UI and UX (NGBootstrap, MDL, CSS Grids, or another method of your choice)

## Bonuses

- Deploy the application in a cloud environment
- Use a **file storage cloud API**, e.g. **Dropbox**, **Google Drive** or other for storing the files

- Use of features of HTML 5 like Geolocation, SVG, Canvas, etc

- Use **Angular Animations** somewhere in your application

- Write **unit tests** for your components

- Use RxJS powered **state management** for Angular applications, inspired by Redux (ngRx store)

- Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use

## Assessment Criteria

- **General Requirements - 75%** 
- **Other Requirements - 25%**

Your project should have adequate error handling and validation. 

Having a "ReadME" file is required.

- **Bonuses - Up to 10%**

Additional functionality or libraries outside the general requirements.

## Restrictions

You can use **parts** (some components, routing configurations, form validation, etc.) of the **course workshop**, but you are **NOT** allowed to use the **whole workshop** as your project assignment.
