# Team Manager

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/07-JS-Applications-Routing.zip) **for this task.**

Create a JS application for managing teams.

Use Handlebars for rendering, `page.js` for routing, and a remote database as a backend provider.

Structure your work so that it is easy to manage.

The example is styled using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

# App Structure

- **Home Page**: show relevant info, depending on the status of the user.

- **Catalog**: a list of all registered teams.

- **About**: dummy page that would hold information about the app.

- **Register User**

- **Create Team**

- **Edit Team**

- **View Team Details**:- a detailed page that shows all members of the team and management controls.

Create a header that is shared across all pages and place links to the relevant sections in it.

# CRUD Operations

The app must support user registration, login, and logout.

Store the user credential in **session storage**.

Once logged in, the user is free to browse all registered teams and **join** or **create** a new team.

At any point, the user is able to **leave** the team he is a member of.

The user can only join **one** team at a time.

Also when a user **creates** a team he **automatically** joins it.

He **cannot** create a team **again** unless he leaves the newly created team.

# Entity Structure

A team has a **name** and a **comment** that is displayed while browsing.

A **user** has a username.

You may create databases and entries as you see fit.

A sample collection structure is as follows:

```
teams {
  name,
  comment
}
```

Add a column **teamId** to the default **users** collection, showing which team they have joined currently.

When determining whether a person is the owner of a team, look at the property `_acl.creator` of the team record.

# Screenshots

Use this information as a guideline.

You may style and structure your solution differently, as long as the required functionality is present.

Home page when the user is logged in and a header, that is shared across all pages.

Home page view for a registered user.

Note the header navigation has changed to reflect that.

Create team and edit team forms are identical.

Team details with the option to join the team and a list of all current members.

Team management.

If the user is a member, they can leave the team.

If the user is the creator, they can edit it.
