# What Are Classes ?

A **class** is like a **blueprint** (or template) for creating **objects**.

Classes provide means of **bundling data and functionality** together.

Each class instance can have **attributes** attached to it.

Class instances can also have **methods** for **modifying its state**, they are its **behavior**.

Example: 

``` js
class Student {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

To declare a class we use the `class` keyword with the name of the class, in this case `Student`.

The `constructor` is a special method for creating and initializing an object.

# Class example

The `class` keyword is used to create a class.

**Class attributes** are **the same for all instances of the class**.

**Instance attributes** are **unique to each instance of the class**.

```js
class Student {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    this.name = name;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}
```

The `this` keyword is used to set a property of the objects to a given value.

This is how we create an **instance** of the `Student` class:

```js
let student = new Student('Peter', 5.50);
```

# Functions in a Class

The ability to modify data is performed by special functions that are a part of the class, which are the methods.

The JavaScript classes support both **instance** and **static** methods. 

Instance methods can access and modify instance data. Instance methods can call other instance methods, as well as any static method. 

``` js live
class Dog {
  constructor() {
    this.speak = () => {
      console.log('Woof');
    }
  }
}

let dog = new Dog();
dog.speak();
```

# Problem: Cats
[code-task title="Cats" executionType="tests-execution" executionStrategy="javascript-code" requiresInput]
[code-editor language=javascript]
```
function cats(input){
  // Write your code here
}
```
[/code-editor]
[task-description]
# Description

Write a function that receives array of strings in the following format `{cat name} {age}`.

Create a Cat class that receives in the constructor the name and the age parsed from the input. 

It should also have a function named `meow` that will print `{cat name}, age {age} says Meow` on the console.

For each of the strings provided you must create a cat object.

# Example
  | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
|`['Mellow 2', 'Tom 5']`| Mellow, age 2 says Meow|
||Tom, age 5 says Meow|

# Hints

* Create a Cat class with properties and methods described above

* Parse the input data

* Create all objects using class constructor and the parsed input data, store them in an array

* Loop through the array using `forâ€¦of` cycle and invoke `.meow()` method
