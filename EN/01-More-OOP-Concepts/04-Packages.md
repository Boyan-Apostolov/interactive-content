# Packages in Java

**Packages are used to group related classes.**
- Like a folder in a file directory

Use **packages** to **avoid** name **conflicts** and to write a **better maintainable code.**

**Packages are divided into two categories:**
- **Built-in Packages** (packages from the **Java API**)
- User-defined Packages (custom packages created by the developer)

## Built-in Packages

**The library is divided into packages and classes.**

Import a single class or a whole package that contains all the classes.
- To use a class or a package, use the import keyword

```java
import package.name.Class; // Import a single class 
import package.name.*;     // Import the whole package
```
