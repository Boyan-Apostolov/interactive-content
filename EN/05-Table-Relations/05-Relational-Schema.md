# Relational Schema

After finishing the design of our database and creating the entities, naturally, we would want to finally see our creation.

Luckily, this is possible through using the tool **E/R Diagrams**.

This tool is integrated into MYSQL and it creates a **Relational schema** of all the entities in the database. 

The relational schemas describe the structure of our database.

**It visualizes:**

- The schemas of all tables

- The relations between tables.

- Any other database object (e.g. constraints)

- It contains only **metadata**, no entity records.
