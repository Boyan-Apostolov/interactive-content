# Description

Your character starts with **100 health points** and **0 bitcoins.**

You will be given a string, **representing different occurrences**, that you have to process.

Each command is **separated** by a vertical bar ("\|").

Every command will contain a **word** and a **number**, separated by a **space**.

The command can be:

* Command "**potion**": 

**Restores** the specified number of **health points** to your character.

The health points **cannot exceed 100.**

After successfully taking a potion, print:

"**Healed:** \{**amount**\} **hp.**"

And after that, print your current health:

"**Current health:** \{**health**\} **hp.**"

* Command "**chest**": 

You have found bitcoins, add this number to the value of your current bitcoins.

**Print**:

"**You found** \{**amount**\} **bitcoins.**"

* Any other input you get means that you are **facing a monster**. 

The word at the **beginning of the command** will be the **monster name** and the **number** \- the **damage that the monster deals to you**.

Examples: "**rat** \{**number**\}, **boss** \{**number**\}", there could be other types of monsters.

You should **decrease your champion's health** points by the **damage** that each monster deals to them.

* If you are **not dead** (health >= 0) you have defeated the monster, and you should print out:

"**You defeated a** \{**monster**\}."

* If **you have died** the expected output is:  

"**You died! Killed by** \{**monster**\}."

**And your quest is over.**

Print the **number** of the **last room you have managed to reach**: 

"**Highest level reached:** \{**last room**\}."

If you **managed to go through all the rooms in the dungeon**, print on the next three lines:

"**You've made it!**"

"**Bitcoins:** \{**bitcoins**\}"

"**Health:** \{**health**\}"

## Input
A **string**, separated by a vertical bar ("\|").

## Output
**Print** the corresponding **messages**, as shown in the description.
