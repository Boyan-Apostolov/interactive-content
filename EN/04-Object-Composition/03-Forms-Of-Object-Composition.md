# Aggregation

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Advanced/05.JS-Advanced-Object-Composition/EN/JS-Advanced-Object-Composition-13-14-aggregation-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

We perform an **aggregation** when an object is formed from an **enumerable** collection of sub-objects. 

This is an object which **contains** other objects. 

Each sub-object keeps its own **reference** identity, such that it could be **destructured** from the aggregation without losing information. 

When to use it:

Whenever there are collections of objects which need to share **common operations**, such as iterables, stacks, queues, or when you want a single item to share the same interface as many items.

# Aggregation Example

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Advanced/05.JS-Advanced-Object-Composition/EN/JS-Advanced-Object-Composition-15-aggregation-example-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

```js live
let dataArray = [{
    id: 'a',
    score: 1
}, {
    id: 'b',
    score: 2
}, {
    id: 'c',
    score: 5
}, {
    id: 'a',
    score: 3
}, {
    id: 'c',
    score: 2
}, ];

let result = dataArray.reduce((acc, curr, index, array) => {
    let same = acc.find(e => e.id === curr.id);
    if (!same) {
        acc.push(curr);
    } else {
        same.score += curr.score;
    }

    return acc;
}, []);

console.log(result);
```

In the example, we have an array of objects. 

To aggregatе them, we will use the `.reduce()` method. 

The `.reduce()` method accepts 4 parameters. 

First is "**acc**", which will be an empty array before the first iteration. 

On each iteration, we will push an object from "**dataArray**" to the "**acc**" or we will update the object if it already exists in the "**acc**".

The second is "**curr**", which is the current element of the "**dataArray**" at a given "**index**".

The third parameter is "**index**", which is the "**dataArray**".

And the last parameter is the array itself - the "**dataArray**".

With the expression `let same = acc.find(e => e.id === curr.id);` we check if we have an object in the "**acc**" with "**id**" equal to the `curr.id` object.

If the statement is **false** we push the current element to the "**acc**", otherwise we update the property "**score**" of the object and we return the "**acc**" on each iteration.

# Concatenation

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Advanced/05.JS-Advanced-Object-Composition/EN/JS-Advanced-Object-Composition-16-concatenation-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Concatenation is when an object is formed by adding new properties to an existing object.

**When to use:**

It can be useful to **progressively assemble** data structures at runtime, like merging JSON objects, hydrating application state from multiple **sources** or creating updates to immutable state by merging previous state with new data. 

```js live
const obj = [{
        name: 'Peter',
        age: 35
    },
    {
        age: 22
    },
    {
        name: 'Steven'
    },
    {
        height: 190
    },
    {
        age: 30
    },
    {
        name: 'Marcus'
    },
    {
        height: 180
    },
    {
        hairColor: 'brown'
    }
];
const concatenate = (acc, curr) => ({
    ...acc,
    ...curr
});
const result = obj.reduce(concatenate, {});
console.log(result);
```

We will use the `.reduce()` method again. 

You can see from the result of the example that order really matters here.

We will use the spread syntax to get the elements of the "**obj**" array. 

If we do not use the spread syntax, in front of "**curr**" variable, we will only get the last element `{hairColor: "brown"}`.

    {
        name: 'Steven'
    },
    {
        height: 180
    }
];
const concatenate = (a, o) => ({
    ...a,
    ...o
});
const c = objs.reduce(concatenate, {});
console.log(c);

# Delegation

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Advanced/05.JS-Advanced-Object-Composition/EN/JS-Advanced-Object-Composition-18-delegation-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Delegation is when an object forwards or "**delegates**" to another object. 

It is commonly used to **imitate** class inheritance in JavaScript. 

JavaScript's built-in types use **delegation** to forward built-in method that calls up the prototype chain: 

- `[].map()` delegates to `Array.prototype.map()`

- `obj.hasOwnProperty()` delegates to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`

# Delegation Example

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Advanced/05.JS-Advanced-Object-Composition/EN/JS-Advanced-Object-Composition-19-delegation-example-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

```js live
const obj = [{
        name: 'Peter',
        age: 35
    },
    {
        age: 22
    },
    {
        name: 'Steven'
    },
    {
        height: 180
    }
];

const delegate = (acc, curr) => Object.assign(Object.create(acc), curr);
const result = obj.reduceRight(delegate, {});

console.log(result);
console.log(result.height);
```

In the example, we use the `.reduceRight()` method. 

First, write called "**delegate**", which will take two parameters. 

The "**acc**" array will be our result after the execution of the `.reduceRight()` method. 

The "curr" variable will be the first element from the "**obj**" array. 

We create an empty object first using the expression `Object.create(acc)`. 

After that, we assign the "**curr**" variable, which is the current element in our "**obj**" array, to the "**acc**" variable using the `Object.assign()` method. 

Then, using `.reduceRight()`, we start from the last element in the "**obj**" array.
