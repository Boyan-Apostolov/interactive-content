# Summary

In this lesson you learned about:

- Object composition - combines data and functions into "JavaScript" objects.

```js
let student = {
    firstName: 'Maria',
    lastName: 'Green',
    age: 22,
    location: { lat: 52.520, lng: 13.404 }
}
```

- Aggregation - forming an object from an enumerable collection.
- Concatenation - adding new properties.
- Delegation - imitates class inheritance.
