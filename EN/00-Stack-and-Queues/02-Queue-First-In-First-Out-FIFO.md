# Queues

**Queues** are data structures similar to **stacks**. 

Queue elements are ordered based on the **FIFO** principle - **First In First Out**. 

When you add an element, it is always placed **at the bottom** of the queue. 

Removing an element removes it from **the top** of the queue.

This data structure is modeled based on queues in real life, where the person who comes first is served before everyone else.

# Implementing Queue with ArrayDeque

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Advanced/02-Stacks-and-Queues/java-advanced-stacks-and-queue-29-30-34-ArrayDeque-Java-Implementation-1-2-3-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- Queue Implementation using the `ArrayDeque<E>` class:

```java
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
```

- `offer(element)` and `add(element)` - both methods add the element to the end of the queue. The difference between them is that

    - `add()` - throws an **exception** if the queue is full

    - `offer()` - returns **false** if the queue is full


- `poll()` and `remove()` - both methods remove the first (the top) element from the queue

    - `remove()` - throws an **exception** if the queue is empty

    - `poll()` - **returns null** if the queue is empty, otherwise returns the removed element


- `peek()` - returns the value of the first element

# Queue Operations

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Advanced/02-Stacks-and-Queues/java-advanced-stacks-and-queue-31-33-Add-Remove-Peak-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

## Add() / Offer()

Both methods are used for adding elements to the top of the queue.

```java live 
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

queue.offer(2);
queue.add(5);
queue.offer(10);
        
System.out.println(queue);
```

They are used in different scenarios:

- if the queue has no size restriction (unlimited capacity queue) - then you can use either of the two functions

- if the queue is capacity-restricted, it is generally better to use `offer()` because if the function fails, it simply returns **false**

- if you use `add()` with a capacity-restricted queue and it fails, this would result in an **IllegalStateException** that has to be handled

## Remove() / Poll()

Both functions remove the first (top) element from the queue, removing it from the queue.

The main difference between the two is that when used on an empty queue `poll()` returns **null**, while `remove()` throws a **NoSuchElementException**.

Here is an example with `poll()`:

```java live
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

queue.offer(2);
queue.add(5);
queue.offer(10);

// remove
System.out.println("The removed element is: " + queue.poll());
queue.forEach(element -> System.out.print(element + " "));
```
It does not matter if we use **remove()** or **poll()** here. Both would do exactly the same because the queue contains elements.

Things are different when working with an empty queue:

```java live
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
System.out.println("The removed element is: " + queue.poll());
```

The above result will be **null** but if you try using `remove()` in the same scenario, the method will throw an error:

```java live
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
System.out.println(queue.remove());
```

Running the last piece of code will result in a **NoSuchElementException**.

## Peek()

This function returns the first element of the queue (the bottom element) without removing it.

```java live
ArrayDeque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

queue.offer(2);
queue.add(5);
queue.offer(10);

System.out.println("The first element is: " + queue.peek());
queue.forEach(element -> System.out.print(element + " "));
```

# Utility Methods

- `size()` - returns the number of elements in the queue:

```java live
ArrayDeque<String> queueOfCars = new ArrayDeque<>();
queueOfCars.add("Of Mice and Men");
queueOfCars.add("The Great Escape");
queueOfCars.add("A Guide in Lucid Dreaming");

System.out.println("The size of this queue is: " + queueOfCars.size());
```

- `toArray()` - converts the queue to an array:

```java live
ArrayDeque<String> queueOfCars = new ArrayDeque<>();
queueOfCars.add("Rocket");
queueOfCars.add("Paper");
queueOfCars.add("Tank");

Integer[] arr = queueOfCars.toArray();

 for (String element: arr) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
```

- `contains(element)` - checks if the queue contains the specified element. Returns **true** if the element is found and **false** if it is not:

```java live
ArrayDeque<String> queueOfCars = new ArrayDeque<>();
queueOfCars.push("Plush Bear");
queueOfCars.push("Ridiculous Rabbit");
queueOfCars.push("Boiler");

System.out.println(queueOfCars.contains("BMW 7"));
```

# Problem with Solution: Hot Potato

[task-description]
## Description
Hot potato is a game, in which **kids form a circle and start passing a hot potato**.

The counting starts with the first kid.

**Every n-th toss the kid, which holds the potato, leaves the game**.

When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato forward.

This continues repeating **until there is only one kid left**.

Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato.

**Print the name of every kid that is removed from the circle**.

In the end, **print the name of the last kid**.

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Maria Peter Johny | Removed Peter |
