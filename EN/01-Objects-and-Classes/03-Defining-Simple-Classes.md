# Defining Simple Classes

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-14-15-defining-simple-classes-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

When defining a class, it contains only those components of a class declaration that are required.

The **obligatory** components are:

- The `class` keyword

- A **name** for the class

- The **body** of the class, between **curly brackets**

Not obligatory, but **credential** components are: 

- Class fields

- Constructor

- Getters and Setters

- Class methods

Each **class**, **field**, **constructor** or **method** is initialized with an **access modifier** in front, which specifies the **accessibility**. 

Ð¢he **access level** can be **changed** by applying the **access modifier** on it. 

We will cover this in the next course. 

There is a possibility to generate **automatically** via IntelliJ IDEA **constructors**, **getters**, **setters**, and other most used methods. 

To do so, just use `Right-click + Generate`. 

The short command depends on the operation system of the computer: 

- In Windows and Linux it is `Alt + Insert` 

- In Macintosh it is `Cmd + N`

# Naming Classes

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-16-naming-classes-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The class name is with the initial letter capitalized by convention, i.e. **PascalCase naming**. 

The class name should contain descriptive nouns.

Abbreviations are required to be avoided (except widely known, e.g. URL, HTTP, etc.).

```java
public class CompanyEmployee {

}
```

[/slide]

[slide hideTitle]

# Class Members

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-17-19-class-members-methods-getters-and-setters-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**Fields** and **methods** define the **state** and **behavior** of a class.

**Fields** provide the state of the class and its objects:

- `String type` 

- `int age`

**Methods** implement the behavior of the class and its objects: 

- `makeSound()`

Consider the following example:

```java
class Car {

    //Field
    private int fuel;

    //Method
    public void drive() {...}
}
```

[/slide]

[slide hideTitle]
# Methods

It was previously covered that methods describe the **behavior** of an object.

They can do so by storing **executable code** which manipulates the **state** when called.

Take a look at how a method affects a field:

```java
class Car {
  public int fuel;

  public int drive(distance) {
    int fuelBurned = distance * 0.1;
    
    // Modifies the state
    this.fuel -= fuelBurned;

    return fuelBurned;
  }
}
```

[/slide]

[slide hideTitle]
# Getters and Setters

A getter and a setter can be declared for each field.

Getters provide **access** to the field and read its value. 

They always begin with the word `get`, followed by the variable name:

- `getColor`

- `getType`

Since the getter method is **return** type, the data type of the value returned by the method is the same as the field type.

Setters **change** and **update** a field's value.

They always begin with the word `set`, followed by the variable name:

- `setColor`

- `setType`

The setter method is of type **void**.

```java
public class Car {
    // field
    private int fuel;
    . . .
    // getter
    public int getFuel() {
        return this.fuel;
    }

    // setter
    public void setFuel(int fuel) {
        this.fuel = fuel;
    }
}
```

[/slide]

# Creating an Object

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-20-22-creating-an-object-constructors-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Each time an object is **created**, some **memory** is **dedicated** for it.

This is why **local variables** are created as **references** to that part of the memory.

The **Java Virtual Machine** is responsible for **tracking** the object references.

If there are **no references** to an object, it becomes **garbage** and is **deleted**.

It is possible to create **many objects** out of one class by using the `new` keyword.

Consider the following example:

```java
class Program {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car sedan = new Car();
    Car coupe = new Car();
  }
}
```

[/slide]

[slide hideTitle]
# Constructor

A special method, executed during object creation, that **sets object's initial state**.

The constructor name is the **same as the name of the class**.

Constructor **can take parameters**, which is used to **initialize fields**.

All classes have **constructor by default**. 

There can be **multiple constructors of the same class**. 

This helps to instantiate objects in various ways with a different number of arguments.

```java
public class Animal {
    // fields
    private String type;
    private int age;
    private boolean herbivorous;

    // constructors
    public Animal() {

    }
    public Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}
```
