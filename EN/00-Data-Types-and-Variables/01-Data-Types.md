# How does a computer work ?

A computer is an **electronic machine** that processes information or, in other words, an **information processor**. It takes the raw information (or data) from one end, stores it until it is ready to process, then returns the results at the other end.

The processing stages **can be defined as follows**: 

Taking in information is done through the "input", information is then stored in "memory", performing computations on information is also known as "processing", the returned results are called "output".

# Variables

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-5-Variables-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

A variable is a location in computer memory, which can be addressed by its name. 

It is the basic storage unit in a program.

* The value stored inside a variable can be changed during the program's execution.

* A variable is only the name given to a memory location, every operation done on the variable affects the memory location.

* In Java all variables must be declared before usage.

```java
int count = 5;
// int – data type
// count – variable name
// 5 – variable value
```

* **Data type**: The type of data that can be stored in this variable
* **Variable name**: The name given to the variable
* **Variable value**: The initial value stored in the variable

A variable can be declared without initialization and then initialized at a later time:

```java
int count;
count = 5;
```

In the example above we declare an `int` variable named `count`, when we need that variable we can assign a value to it.

Here we gave that variable the value of `5`.

## Real Life Example
You can think of variables as kitchen jars. 

Imagine that in each jar you can only store one of the following: salt, sugar, or coffee.

In programming, it is almost the same. 

We use variables that act as containers for different data types like: numbers, text, symbols, and so on. 

For example, if we have a variable meant to hold integers we will not be able to store text in it.

# What is a Data Type?

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-6-What-is-data-type-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in variables. 

There are **two general data types** in Java:

**Primitive data types**

-	Built-into the programming language

-	The size and type of the variable values are stronly specified and they cannot be modified

- Examples: `boolean`, `char`, `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`


**Non-primitive data types**

-	Not defined by the programming language but by the programmer

-	They are also called "reference types" since they hold an address in computer memory (RAM) where the data is stored

-	Some examples are `String`, `Arrays`, and `Classes`

# Data Type Characteristics

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-7-data-type-characteristics-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

```java
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String
```
**Data types** have the following characterstics:

* **Name**: a Java keyword

* **Size**: how much memory is used

* **Value**: every variable holds a value

Non-primitive data types hold references to the location of a value in memory

# Naming Variables

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-8-naming-our-variables-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

In programming a naming convention is a set of **rules** to be followed when choosing names for variables and other code elements.

Naming conventions make programs more understandable and easier to read. 

In Java the naminc convention called "**camelCase**" is observed.

"**camelCase**" is characterized by:

- Each word or abreviation (excluding the starting one) begins with a capital letter

- A camelCase name contains no spaces

- A camelCase name contains no punctuation

```Java
String firstName = John; //correct
String lastName = Smith; //correct
int personAge = 41;      //correct

String Firstname = John;  //incorrect
String last_name = Smith; //incorrect
int PersonAge = 41;       //incorrect
int foo = 2;              //incorrect
```
The variable's name should explain its purpose.

When naming a variable, it should answer the question: **What does this variable contain?**

# Variable Scope and Lifetime

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-9-variable-scope-and-lifetime-and-demo-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The **scope** of a variable has to do with which areas or sections of a program can the variable accessed.

The **lifetime** of a variable refers to how long the variable is kept in the memory.

Generally, the scope of a variable is limited to the code block, in which it is created.

A block **begins** with an opening curly bracket `{` and **ends** with a closing curly bracket `}`.

## Example
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  String outer = "I'm inside the Main()";

  //Beginning of inner block
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      String inner = "I'm inside the loop";
      System.out.println(inner); //print the result
  }
  //End of inner block

  System.out.println(outer);

  // System.out.println(inner); Error
```

# Variable Span

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-10-variable-span-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Variable **span** is how long before a variable is called after its declaration.

It is a good practice to create a variable as **late as possible** (shorter span), right before it is needed.

```java
static void main(String[] args) {
  String outer = "I'm inside the main()";

  //beginning of "outer" variable span
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    String inner = "I'm inside the loop";
    System.out.println(inner);
  }
   //end of "outer" variable span

  System.out.println(outer);
  //System.out.println(inner); Error
}
```

# Keeping Variable Span Short

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Methods-And-Arrays/01.Java-Fundamentals-Data-types-and-variables/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-data-types-and-variables-11-keep-variable-span-short-and-demo-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

As a rule of thumb, try to keep the variable span as short as possible.

A shorter variable span simplifies computer code and improves its **readability** and **maintainability**.

We can reduce the **outer** variable span using the previous example:

```java
static void main(String[] args) {
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    String inner = "I'm inside the loop";
    System.out.println(inner);
  }

  //beginning of "outer" variable span
  String outer = "I'm inside the main()";
  System.out.println(outer);
  //end of "outer" variable span

  //System.out.println(inner); Error
}
```
