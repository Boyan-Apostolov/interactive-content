The actions that a program takes, are expressed as **statements**.

JavaScript supports **several different** kinds of statements and here are a few of them:

* **Declaration** statements: declare local variables and constants

* **Expression** statements: evaluate expressions

* **Selection** statements: select one of a number of possible statements

* **Iteration** statements: execute repeatedly an embedded statement

* **Jump** statements: transfer control
  
Common actions include

-  **Declaring** a variable

  Declaring a variable means defining its type.

```js
let counter;
```

-  **Assigning** a value

After we declare a variable, we can assign a value to it.
  
Assigning a value to a variable means storing a value to a variable.

  ```js
  counter = 1;
  ```

- Declaring \+ initializing

  ```js
  let counter = 1;
  ```

- Printing a value

```js live
let counter = 1;
console.log(counter);
```

- **Modifying** a value

  ```js
  counter++;
  ```
  
  ```js
  let sum = a + b;
  ```
