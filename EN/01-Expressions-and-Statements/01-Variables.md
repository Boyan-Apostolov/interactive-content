In programming, each **variable** stores a certain value of a particular data type. 

Data types can be: number, letter, text (string), date, color, image, list and others. 

Here are some examples of data types:
* Integer: 1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 20, …
* Float: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
* Character (symbol): 'a', 'b', 'c', '@', 'X', …
* Text (string): "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", …
* Day of week: Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday
* Date and time: 14-June-1980 6:30:00, 25-Dec-2017 23:17:22

**Variables** can ve viewed as containers for data or named areas in computer memory. The data that they store can be read and changed at any time. 

**Variables** provide means for:
  * **Storing** data
  * **Retrieving** stored data
  * **Modifying** stored data
  
  
  Each variable has:
  * Name (identifier)
  * Type (of the information preserved)
  * Value (stored information)



Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it a value at the same time:
```java
String name = "Bob";
boolean employed = true;
int age = 35;
```
If you think of variables as boxes that hold information, this is how they would look:

Variables can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - in the execution **stack**
  * Dynamic memory - in the **heap**
