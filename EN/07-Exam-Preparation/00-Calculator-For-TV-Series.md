# Description

Create a program that calculates how long it will take you to watch all episodes of a TV series in **minutes**.

You will receive the **number of seasons**, **the number of episodes per season**, and **the duration of each episode**.

In every episode, there are **advertisements**, whose duration is 20% of the episode's duration.

Every season ends with a special episode, which lasts **10 minutes longer than usual**.

## Input

You will receive 4 lines from the console:

- Title of the series - **string**
- Number of seasons - **integer** in range [1 ... 10]
- Number of episodes - **integer** in range [10 ... 80]
- Duration of each episode, not including the advertisements - **double** in the range [40.0 ... 65.0]

## Output

You have to print on the console that time needed to watch all of the episodes, rounded down to the nearest whole number in the following format:

- "**Total time needed to watch the** \{**name of the series**\} **series is** \{**time**\} **minutes.**"


## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | 
| Lucifer   | Total time needed to watch the Lucifer series is 3594 minutes. |
| 3         |
| 18        |
| 55        |
