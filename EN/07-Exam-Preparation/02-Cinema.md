# Description
For the upcoming premiere of three popular productions a local cinema has hired you to write software that calculates the price, which the clients should pay, depending on the movie and the offer they choose.

| -  | **John Wick** | **Star Wars**| **Jumanji** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drink | $12 | $18 | $9 |
| Popcorn | $15 | $25 | $11 |
| Menu | $19 | $30 | $14 |

Create a program that calculates the **total price** of the tickets.

Discounts should be applied in the following cases:

- If the chosen movie is **"Star Wars"** and at least four tickets are bought, there is a **30%** family discount
- If the chosen movie is **"Jumanji"** and the tickets bought are **exactly two**, there is a **15%** couple discount

## Input
You will receive 3 lines:

- Name of the movie - string: **"John Wick"**, **"Star Wars"** or **"Jumanji"**

- Type of the offer - string: **"Drink"**, **"Popcorn"** or **"Menu"**

- Number of the tickets â€“ integer number in range [1 ... 30]

## Output
Print out on a single line: **"Your bill is $** \{**total price**\}**"**

The price must be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | 
| John Wick | Your bill is $72.00 | 
| Drink | 
| 6 |
