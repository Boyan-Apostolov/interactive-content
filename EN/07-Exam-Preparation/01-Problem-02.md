## Description
During your lunch break you want to watch an episode of your favorite TV series.

Your task is to write a program that will help you determine whether you have enough time to watch an entire episode.

During your lunchbreak you should also take some time to eat and relax.

You know, that the time you need to finish your lunch takes up precisely `1/8`(an eight) of your break and the time you need for relaxation will be exactly `1/4` (a quarter) of your total break time.


## Input
You will receive 3 lines from the console:

- Name of the series: string

- Duration of an episode: a whole number in the range \[10… 90\]

- Break duration: a whole number in the range \[10… 120\]

## Output
The output should consist of one line:

- If there is enough time to watch the episode: 

`You have enough time to watch {name of the series} and would be left with {time left} minutes of free time.`

- If there is not enough time: 

`You don't have enough time to watch {name of the series}, you need {time needed} more minutes.`

Round the time up to the nearest whole number.

## Input

# Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
|`['Game of Thrones', '60', '96']`| You have enough time to watch Game of Thrones and would be left with 0 minutes of free time.|

**Comments**

Time for lunch: `96 * 1/8 = 12.0`

Time to relax: `96 * 1/4 = 24.0`

Time left: `96 - 12 - 24 = 60`

In this case, the time you would have left is more than or equal to the duration of the episode.

Make sure that the right output is printed out.
