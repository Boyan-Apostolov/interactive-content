# The Best Movie
## Description
It is Friday night, and you are wondering which movie to watch. 

You decide to write a program to choose it for you. 

Until receiving the command `STOP` you will be given the titles of some of your favorite movies. 

The best movie for you will be the one that has the most points. 

The points are calculated by the sum of the ASCII character values in the movie title. 

There will not be a case where we have two films have an equal amount of points

Keep in mind the following:
- For each lowercase letter from the title, you must subtract from the sum the length of the movie title multiplied by 2.

- For each uppercase letter in the title, the length of the film's title should be subtracted from the sum.

- You can have a maximum of 7 movie titles.

## Input
You receive multiple lines from the console until the command `STOP` or until the limit of 7 movies is reached:
- Movie title â€“ string;

## Output
Print on the console:
- If you have reached the limit of 7 movies you must print: `The limit is reached.`
- Print the best movie for you: `The best movie for you is {movie title} with {sum of symbols} ASCII sum.`

## Input
Matrix

Breaking bad

Legend

STOP

## Output
The best movie for you is Breaking bad with 878 ASCII sum.

## Comments

First we get **Matrix**, the first letter is M with a value of 77, it is a capital letter so we subtract from it the length of the title `77 - 6 = 71`.

The second letter has a value of 97 and we subtract from its title length *2 from the sum `97 - 12 = 85`.

Similarly, we proceed with each subsequent letter until we receive the final amount of 563.

Upon receiving the `STOP` command, we print the title with the highest value, which is **Breaking** bad with a sum of 878.
