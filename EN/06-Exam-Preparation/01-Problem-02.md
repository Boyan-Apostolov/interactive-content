* On the second line, you will you will receive the current state of the lift separated by ` ` (empty space).

## Output

**When there is no more available space left on the lift,** or **there are no more people in the queue**, you should print on the console the final state of the lift's wagons separated by ` ` (empty space) and one of the following messages:

* If there are no more people and the lift have empty spots you should print:

`The lift has empty spots!`

`{wagons separated by ' '}`

* If there are still people on the queue and no more available space, you should print:
