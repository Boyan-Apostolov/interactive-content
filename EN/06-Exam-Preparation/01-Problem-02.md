# Description
Write a function that checks for **empty seats on a lift.**

Each of the cabins of the lift can fit no **more than 4 people.**

If a cabin is full, you should direct the people to the next one with available seats.

## Input

* On the first line, you will receive the number of people waiting in line to get on the lift


* On the second line, you will receive the current state of the lift - a string of numbers "(0-4)" each number representing the number of people in each next cabin, separated by an empty space


## Output

When you run out of empty seats, or if there are no more people on the queue, you should print out one of the following messages:

* If there are no more people queueing but there are some seats left on the lift:

"**There is room for more passengers!**"

Followed by:

"\{**the state of each cabin, separated by ' '**\}"

* If there are people left on the queue but no more seats available:

"**The lift is full.** \{**people**\} **people currently in line.**"

Followed by:

"\{**the state of each cabin, separated by ' '**\}"

* If the lift is full and there are no more people waiting to get in, you should just print out the state of each cabin separated by a single space

## Example One

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
|lift([15, '0 0 0 0'])| There is room for more passengers! |
||4 4 4 3 |

**Comment**

* First state: 4 0 0 0 \-\> 11 people left

* Second state: 4 4 0 0 \-\> 7 people left

* Third state: 4 4 4 0 \-\> 3 people left

## Example Two

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
|lift([20, '0 2 0'])|The lift is full. 10 people currently in line.|
||4 4 4|

**Comment**

* First state - 4 2 0 \-\> 16 people left

* Second state - 4 4 0 \-\> 14 people left

* Third state - 4 4 4 \-\> 10 people left, but there are no more empty seats
