## Description

The Wireâ€™s parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning an epic party at home. 

Unfortunately, his organizational skills are next to non-existent so you are given the task to help him with the reservations.

On the first line you get a **list** with all the **people** that are coming. 

On the next lines, until you get the "**Party**!" command, you may be asked to **double** or **remove** all the people that apply to **given criteria**. 

There are three different options: 

- Everyone that has a name **starting** with a given string;
- Everyone that has a name **ending** with a given string;
- Everyone that has a name with a given **length**.

When you print the guests that are coming to the party, you have to print them in **asscending** order. 

If nobody is going, print "**Nobody is going to the party!**". 

See the examples below:
