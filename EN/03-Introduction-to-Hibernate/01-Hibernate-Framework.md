# Hibernate Framework

Hibernate is a open-source Java ORM framework that take care of mapping an object-oriented model to a relational database.

It is implemented by the configuration of an **XML file** or by using **Java Annotations.**

Hibernate provides an abstract layer for us, meaning that software developers doesn't need to worry about the implementations.

Hibernate does the things for us directly like **connection with the database, writing a queries for CRUD operations and more.**

Using ORM like hibernate improves our productivity by giving us high-level oriented API and removes the needs to write pure SQL.

It helps us improving our performance, maintainability and portability.
