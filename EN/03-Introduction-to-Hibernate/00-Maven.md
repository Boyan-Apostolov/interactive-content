# Maven

Maven is a project management framework. It is used to describe how software is built and it's dependencies.

Maven is working with **XML** files.

The concept of Maven is build around form lifecycle.

That's mean the process around building a particular project is clearly defined.

It is only necessary for us, to learn a small list of commands to build any Maven project. 

The **Pom** file will ensure we get the results we desired.

Projects are configured using a Project Object Model, which is stored in **pom.xml** file.

Now, let's see how can we create a project from beginning.

- Select "Maven" project from the new project panel:

[image assetsSrc="Hibernate.jpg" /]

- Choose name of the project, current Project group and project version.

[image assetsSrc="Hibernate(2).jpg" /]

- Set up project **name** and **location.** 

[image assetsSrc="Hibernate(3).jpg" /]

- Enable Maven **auto-import.**

[image assetsSrc="Hibernate(4).jpg" /]
