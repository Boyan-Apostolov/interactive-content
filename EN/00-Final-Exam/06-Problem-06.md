# Problem 6: Tournament of Christmas 

[slide hideTitle]

# Description

Write a program that tracks your team's performance at a Christmas charity tournament. 

Every day you get game names next to the `Finish` command. 

By winning each game you win **$20 for charity**. 

You need to calculate how much **money you earned at the end of the day**. 

If you have **more games won than lost** - **you are the winner of the day** and your money is increased by 10%. 

At the **end of the tournament**, if you have been the winner most days, you **win the tournament and increase all the money won by 20%.**

You will never have an equal number of won and lost games.


## Input

**The input comes as an array of elements:**

- **First Element:**

 **The number of days of the tournament is read from the console**: an integer in the interval \[1… 20\]

- **Until you receive the** `Finish` **command, read:**

**Sport** – string

- **For each sport read:**

**Result** - text with possibilities:  `win` or `lose`

## Output

Finally, one line is printed:

- If you won, the tournament: 

`You won the tournament! Total raised money: {the money earned}`

- If you lost, the tournament: 

`You lost the tournament! Total raised money: {the money earned}`

The money should be **formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.**

# Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
|`['2', 'volleyball', 'win', 'football','lose', 'basketball', 'win', 'Finish', 'golf', 'win', 'tennis', 'win', 'badminton', 'win', 'Finish']` | You won the tournament! Total raised money: 132.00 |

# Comments

The tournament **is 2 days.**

The first day:

- We play volleyball and win `$20`
- We play football and lose `$0`
- We play basketball and win `$20`

We get the `Finish` command and the games for the day are over. 

Earned money `20 + 0 + 20 = $40.` 

We have more games won than lost, respectively we increase the money of the day by `10% -> $44`.

The second day:

- We play golf and win `$20`
- We play tennis and win  `$20`
- We play badminton and win `$20`

We get the `Finish` command and the games for the day are over.

Earned money `20 + 20 + 20 = $60` 

We have only won games, respectively we increase the money of the day by `10% -> $66`.

Earned money from both days: `44 + 66 = $ 110`

Because we have more wins than losses, we win the tournament and increase the money by `20% -> $132`
