# Inheritance

**Inheritance is a mechanism by which it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.**

- The class **giving its members** to its child class is called **Superclass** (Base Class, Parent class)
- The class **taking members** from its base class is called **Subclass** (Child class, Derived Class)
