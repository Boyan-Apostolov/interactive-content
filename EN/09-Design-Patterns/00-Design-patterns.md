# Design Patterns

Hello to next lesson in our module.

Today, we will review a concept behind **Design Patterns**. What are they? How we can use them? We will answer this and much more questions!

Lets begin!

So, what are **design patterns**?

In software engineering design patterns represents **general** and **reusable solutions** to frequent problems in software design.

It is important to understand, that design patterns **by themselves are not finished and ready for implementation templates**.

They are more like a **description of templates** for how to solve problems that can be used in many situations.

Why we use **design patterns**?

By using design patterns we can solve software structural problems and speed the development process by providing **well proven development paradigms**.

Also, we can prevent later issues that can cause serious problems and by using design patterns we improve code readability.

Most common problems that design pattern solves are:

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Separation of concerns 

- Coupling and cohesion

- Separation of interface and implementation

- Divide and conquer
