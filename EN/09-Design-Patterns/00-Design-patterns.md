# Design Patterns

So, what are **design patterns?**

In software engineering design patterns represents **general** and **reusable solutions** to frequent problems in software design.

It is important to understand, that design patterns **by themselves are not finished and ready for implementation templates**.

They are more like a **description of templates** for how to solve problems that can be used in many situations.

Why we use **design patterns**?

By using design patterns we can solve software structural problems and speed the development process by providing **well-proven development paradigms**.

Also, we can prevent later issues that can cause serious problems and by using design patterns we improve code readability.

Most common problems that design pattern solves are:

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Separation of concerns 

- Coupling and cohesion

- Separation of interface and implementation

- Divide and conquer

Let's see the Elements of our design patterns:

- Pattern name that increases the **vocabulary** of designers

- Problem - Intent, context, and when to apply

- Solution - An abstract code, or template idea to solve our problems

- Consequences - **Results** and trade-offs

# Benefits and drawbacks of using Design Patterns

## Benefits

Now, we will talk a little bit about the benefits and drawbacks of using design patterns.

Let's start first with the benefits:

Design patterns bring standardization to your projects. It also ensures, that your code follows good programming principles like **coupling** and **cohesion**.

We learn in previous lessons the basics of **coupling** and **cohesion**, but today we will try to expand our knowledge a little bit.

We can say that coupling components interact with each other. This is how they pass the information on each other. High coupling usually leads to complex code.

We cannot remove entirely the need for components to interact with each other.

Usually, low coupling indicates a **good code structure**.

The coupling has many types, but we would not go that further.

Design patterns can make our job easier. They can help us analyze the more abstract ideas of our program by **providing well-tested solutions**.

It is important to understand, that design patterns teach us to write **faster** and **more clear** code. It provides us a clearer picture of how we are implementing the software design.

## Drawbacks

Unfortunately, design patterns **do not lead** to direct code reuse.

Sometimes we tend to **overload** and **overdesign** our patterns.

Design patterns should be used only if they are well understood by the developers.

Often they are used improperly without a realistic understanding of how our software **is going to change in the future**.

Now, let's continue to the next important information in our lesson: **Design Pattern Types**
