# Part 1: Accessing Database via Simple Java Application - Demo/

## Description 

You are given a simple java program that opens a connection to a local database server and retrieves the following data – first name and last name from the “soft_uni” database. 

The data is filtered by salary criteria, which is given by the user at the input. 

The exercise shows briefly the usage of the java.sql package and the MySQL Connector/J driver

## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
|---|---|
| 70000.00   | Ken Sanchez James Hamilton Brian Welcker |
| 80000.00  | Ken Sanchez James Hamilton   |
|   |   |

# 1. Connection and Connection Properties

## Description

Up to this point, we have used the HeidiSQL or Workbench GUI to connect to our local instance of MySQL server. 

[image assetsSrc="Spring-Data-Database-Access-With-JDBC-Lab(1).png" /]

From now on we will achieve this with Java code using the JDBC API.

The following code shows how a connection is created:

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("user", user);
props.setProperty("password", password);

Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/soft_uni", props);
```

Let's look closely at what is happening there. 

A **Properties** class, which holds the username and the password of the user, is being instantiated. 

The username and the password are given beforehand by the input. 

They are passed as an argument to the **DriverManager** static class’s method **getConnection** via the props instance.

The **getConnection** method is a static method, which establishes a connection, for which the **DriverManager** selects the appropriate driver – the **MySQL Connector/J driver** in our case.

The **getConnection** method requires a second argument – a **connection string**. 

A **connection string** is a string, which holds information about the data source and consists of a database name and other parameters required to establish an initial connection. 

In our case these parameters are:

-   host and port of our local server – **localhost:3306**.

-   database name – can be diverse, but by the means of our assignment, it is **soft_uni**.

-   user – by default **root**, or any other **specified by the user**.

-   password – user password for connection if there is one.

Remember that the user and the password are already included in the **Properties** instance **props**.

# 2. Preparing and Executing Statements.

## Description 

SQL execution is done via the **Statement Interface**. To prevent SQL Injection, **PreparedStatement** is used:

```java
PreparedStatement stmt =
    connection.prepareStatement("SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE salary > ?");
String salary = sc.nextLine();
stmt.setDouble(1, Double.parseDouble(salary));
```

The user is asked to set the salary criteria, by which we will filter the results. 

Then we use the **connection** to prepare a **PreparedStatement** and pass an unfinished SQL query, to which we must append the value for the salary criteria. 

The question mark is a placeholder for that value. The **setDouble** method accepts two parameters – the index of the parameter to be replaced and the value. 

If we had done plain concatenation using only **Statement** and appended the value for the **salary** to the query, we would have made our program vulnerable to SQL Injection, because we wouldn’t be checking the value. 

It could be another SQL query, which in the worst case would harm our database. 

Therefore, we use **PreparedStatement**, **setDouble** and **Double.parseDouble** methods, to insure that the value is as expected – a **double** number.

# 3. Iterating over the Result

## Description 

Finally, if data in the database matches the given criteria, we will receive a **ResultSet** of table rows, otherwise, it will be empty. 

```java
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
```

The **ResultSet** object is a table of data. 

It is not updatable and it can be read only from first to last. 

Thus it keeps a cursor pointing to the rows of the table. 

Field values can be accessed via **getter** methods, such as **getString**, which accepts column name:

```java
while(rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString("first_name") + " " + rs.getString("last_name"));
}
```

# Part 2: Writing your own data retrieval application

## Description 

Now it’s time for you to write a similar program.

Follow the steps to write a java application that retrieves information about the users, their games, and duration.

We are going to use the **“diablo”** database from the previous course. 

## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
|---|---|
| nakov   | User: nakov Svetlin Nakov has played 6 games |
| destroyer  | No such user exists  |
|   |   |

# 1. Establish a connection to the database

## Description 

Get the user’s **username** and **password** and change the connection string according to the name of the database.

# 2. Username and statement

## Description

Ask the user for a username, which you will use to retrieve the desired info. Write a proper SQL statement to get the result.

# 3.Output

## Description 

Consider that the input may be invalid – **user with given username might not exist** and you will receive an empty **ResultSet**. 

If so, print **“No such user exists”**, otherwise, print the **user_name**, **first** and **last names** and the total **count** of games a user has played
