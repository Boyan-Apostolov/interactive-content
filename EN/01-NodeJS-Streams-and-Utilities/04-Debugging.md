Debugging in Node.js is done by using the **V8 debugging protocol**, which is a **JSON-based** protocol.

We can also use **IDE**s with a debugger like:

- **Webstorm**

- **Visual Studio Code**

- **Node-inspector** (not working with the latest version)

Use "**Nodemon**" to watch for changes in your application.

It helps development by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
