In this lesson you learned:
- There are **eight data types** in JavaScript: 
    - Number
    - String
    - Symbol
    - null
    - undefined
    - Object
    - Boolean
    - BigInt

- `let` has block scope, `var` has function scope

- With `typeof` we can receive the type of a variable

- `Null` is "nothing",  undefined exists, but is empty
