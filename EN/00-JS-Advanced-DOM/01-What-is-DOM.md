# What is DOM?

# Document Object Model

Every web page is an HTML document, which consists of plain text and tags.

Having to work **directly** with text at a large website is a tedious task.

The DOM eases working with HTML by **translating it to objects**, which can easily be manipulated by Javascript.

DOM is simply a **link** between HTML documents and the Javascript programming language.

Through DOM manipulations the developer can:

- `Get an HTML element`

- `Change an element`

- `Add a new element`

- `Delete an element`

Here is an example of an HTML element:

```js
<p>This is some random text</p>
```

In the example the element is surrounded by opening and closing tags, specifying its type (in this case - a paragraph)

Between the two tags, there is the text value of the element.

# HTML DOM

The HTML DOM is an Object Model for the HTML document.

It defines:

- `HTML elements as objects`

- `Properties`

- `Methods`
