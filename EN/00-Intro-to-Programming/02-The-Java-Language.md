# Programming Languages

A programming language is an artificial language created for declaring commands that we want a computer to **read**, **process**, and **execute**..

Using programming languages we compile **sequences of commands** (programs), which define actions to be executed by the computer. 

Some popular programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go. 

These languages differ in their syntax, purpose, programming constructions, execution environment.

The execution of computer programs can be done using a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**.

## Compilers
The **compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks** the code of the program for **errors**. 

Together, all compiled fragments build up the program machine code, making it executable by a **microprocessor**.

## Interpreters
The **interpreter** is "a **program which executes programs**". 

An interpreter itself is also written in a programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program code **one after another**, as it can process not only a single command or sequences of commands, but also more complicated programming language constructions.

# The Java Language

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/00-intro-programming/EN/Java-basics-introduction-to-programming-12-The-Java-Language-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**Java** is a modern, general-purpose programming language.

It is versatile and can be used to create all sorts of programs: from Web and mobile apps to games and back-end functionality.

The demand for Java developers is currently among the highest. 

This greatly increases the chances of professional realization for those who acquire the necessary skills. 

Java is used by about **7,1 million** programmers around the world (according to SlashData). 

Java is also one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**. 

* It is easy to learn Java through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**

It combines **procedural**, **object-oriented** and **functional programming** with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# Java Compilation and Execution

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/00-intro-programming/EN/Java-basics-introduction-to-programming-13-Java-compilation-and-execution-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations, and other similar operations, which aim to obtain a certain result.

A Java program is created in a text format, and the text of the program is called **source code**. 

It gets compiled into an **executable file** or gets **executed directly** by the runtime environment (JRE).

The process of **code compilation** before its execution is used only by **compiled** languages like C#, Java, and C++. 

When using **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python, and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.

# JDK and JRE

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/00-intro-programming/EN/Java-basics-introduction-to-programming-14-15-JDK-JRE-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

## JDK â€“ Java Development Toolkit

* The Java SDK (Software Development Kit)  is a toolset for developers
* It includes a **Virtual Machine** (JVM), a **Java Compiler** (javac), and some other developer tools
* JDK is available for free download from Oracle at the following [link](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)

JDK should not be confused with a runtime environment (JRE)

* JRE allows us to **run** Java programs, but does not provide the option to **develop programs**
