In programming, each **variable** stores a certain value. Each value has a particular data type. 

Data types varry according to the information they hold: number, letter, text (string), date, color, image, list and others. 

Here are some examples of data types:
* **Integer** - used to store whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 20, …
* **Float** - used to store decimal numbers: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
* **Character** - holds letters and other charachters: 'a', 'b', 'c', '@', 'X', …
* **String** - used to store text: "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", …
* There could be variables storing days (**DayOfWeek**): Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday
* **Date and time**: 14-June-1980 6:30:00, 25-Dec-2017 23:17:22

**Variables** can be viewed as "containers" for data (or named areas in computer memory). The data that they store can be read and changed at any time. 

**Variables** provide means for:
  * **Storing** data
  * **Retrieving** stored data
  * **Modifying** stored data
  
  
  Each variable has:
  * A Name (identifier)
  * A Data Type (of the information preserved)
  * A Value (stored information)



We can declare a variable and assign a value to it simultaneously:
```java
String name = "Bob";
boolean employed = true;
int age = 35;
```
If you think of variables as boxes that hold information, this is how they would look:

Variables can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - the execution **stack**
  * Dynamic memory - also refered to as **heap**
