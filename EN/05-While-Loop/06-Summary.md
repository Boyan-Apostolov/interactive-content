## In this lesson you learned: 

- What **while-loops** are and how we can use them

```java
while (condition) {
  loop body;
}
```

- Difference between **while-loop** and **for-loop**

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
while (true) {
  int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
  
  if (number % 2 != 0) {
    break;
  }
}
```

- What **infinity loops** are 


## In the next lesson you will learn:

- Complex **for-loops** with a special step

- What nested loops are and how we can use them
