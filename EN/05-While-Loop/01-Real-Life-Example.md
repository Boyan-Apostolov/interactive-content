The next type of loops that we will get familiar with are called `while` loops. 

The specific thing about them is that they repeat a block of commands while a condition is `true`. 

As a structure, they differ from `for` loops, and even have a simple syntax.

Before we jump to the lesson, let's cover оне море example from the real life.

You have to fill a bucket with water using a mug.

You never know how many mugs of water you will use.

You will stop when the bucket is full.

In this example, you work until satisfying a given condition.
