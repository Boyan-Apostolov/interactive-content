The next type of loops that we will get familiar with is the so-called **while-loops**. 

**While-loops** execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is **true**.

As structure, they differ from the **for-loops** and their syntax is even simpler.

Let us see a real life example.

You need to fill a bucket with water using a mug.

You do not know how many mugs of water you will suffice.

You will stop when the bucket is full.

In this example, you work until reaching a certain condition.
