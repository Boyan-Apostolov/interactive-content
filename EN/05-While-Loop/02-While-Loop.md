# While-Loop

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/05-while-loops/EN/Java-While-Loops-5-6-7-While-Loops-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

In programming, a **while-loop** is used when we want to **repeat** the execution of a certain logic while a specified condition is reached. 

By **"condition"**, we understand every **expression** that returns `true` or `false`. If the **condition** returns **false**, the while loop is **interrupted**, and the program **continues** to execute the remaining code after the loop. 

[image assetsSrc="05-use-case-while.png" /]

The **syntax of the while-loop** looks like this:
```java
while (condition) {
  loop body;
}
```

In the example above, the condition can be any **expression that returns a Boolean result** – `true` or `false`. 

How many times the loop body will be repeated depends on the `condition`. 

In this example, the `loop body` is the programming code that is executed at each iteration of the loop, whenever the **condition is true**.

In the **while-loop**, the **condition** is evaluated first, and if it returns **true**, then the statements inside the loop execute.  

Next, the condition is checked again, and if it is **true**, the body of the loop is executed. 

This process is repeated again and again **until the conditional expression returns** `false`. 

Then, the control comes out of the loop and jumps to the next statement after the **while-loop** .


## Example: Sequence of Numbers 2k+1
Create a program that prints all **numbers that are smaller than or equal to `n`**. The first number will be equal to **1**. The second number will be equal to **1*2+1**, which is equal to **3**. Each next number is calculated by the formula: **previous number * 2 + 1**.
Therefore, the first few numbers are: **1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …,** 

Here is how we can solve the problem:
- First, we create a **num** variable for the current number, to which we assign an **initial value of 1**
- For a loop condition, we specify that **the current number should be smaller than or equal to `n`**
- In **the body of the loop**, we print the value of the **current number**, and we increase it by using the formula provided in the problem's description

Here is a sample implementation of this idea:
```java live
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
int num = 1;
while (num <= n) {
  System.out.println(num);
  num = 2 * num + 1;
}
```

## Description
Create a program that:

* Reads a number from the console
* Prints all the numbers between the **input number** and **1** (**inclusive**), each on a new line

[task-description]
## Description
Create a program that:

* Reads a **number** from the console
* Checks if the number is in the range between **1 and 100**
* If it is not in the range - reads a **new number**
* If it is - **prints the number** and the program stops

## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| ---- | ---- |
| -10 | 50 |
| 101 |
| 50 |
