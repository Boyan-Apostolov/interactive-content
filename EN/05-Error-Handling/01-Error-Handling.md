# Error Handling

**Errors** happen at any time but what matters is the way we **handle** and **rectify** them to maintain.

Every programing language has a **powerful mechanism** to **handle** these errors and exceptions.

Effective exception handling makes our program more robust and **easier** to **debug**.

An exception is a problem that arises during the **execution of a program** it can occur for many different reasons for example:

- User has entered an invalid data 

- File that needs to be opened cannot be found 

- A network connection that has been lost in the middle of communications and many more

If we **do not handle them** it leads to a system **failure**.

So handing an exception is very **important** and that is where Java introduced an **exception handling mechanism** to handle the runtime errors.

That way the normal **execution flow will not be interrupted**.

## Error Handling Example

**Correct way** of handling an error:

When an error occurs we should strive to show to the **user only a simple message**, which says that an **error occurs**, and will be fixed.

Incorrect way of handling an error:

The user **does not need to know the entire stack trace** of an error, thus it is important to **not show the raw error message**.

# Error Handling in Spring

Spring already comes with **built-in support for error handling** and that is where the annotations for the **exception handling** comes into the picture.

Depending on the case we can **choose an option more suitable** for our cases and circumstances:

- **Response-annotated** - custom exceptions
- **Controller-based** - they are methods into the controller, which can handler specific exception
- `@ControllerAdvise` annotated - it is used for global error handling

# Custom Error Page

When working with Thymeleaf we can **create** an `error.html` file and place it into the `resources/templates` directory, that way Spring framework **by default will use this error page**.

This way we can make errors more **custom-looking** and **user-friendly**. 

The custom error page in Spring looks like this:

# ErrorController Interface

Spring Boot maps `/error` to `BasicErrorController` which **populates** the model with error **attributes** and then returns "**error**" as the view name.

To replace `BasicErrorController` with our custom controller which can map to `/error`, we need to implement the `ErrorController` interface.

Example: 

```java
@Controller
public class MyErrorController implements ErrorController {
  @RequestMapping("/error")
  @ResponseBody
  public String handle(HttpServletRequest request) {
    //Some code ...
  }
  @Override
  public String getErrorPath() {
    return "/error";
  }
}
```
This is an example of a **custom error controller** named `MyErrorController`, which implements `ErrorController`.

# HTTP Status Codes

A controller always **returns a response**, but when an exception occurs, the controller **response is 500**, which stands for internal server error.

When we create a costume exception we can set **response status annotation**, that way we have **full control** of what **status code** the controller will **return**.

Example: 

```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, reason = "Product was not found.")
public class ProductNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
  // Exception definition
}
```

Here we have a regular **runtime error**, where we have set `@ResponseStatus`, and that way we control the returned status code.

## Controller Action, Throwing the Exception

```java
@GetMapping("/products/details/{id}")
public ModelAndView productDetails(@PathVariable String id, ModelAndView modelAndView) {
  Product product = this.productRepository.findProductById(id);

  if (product == null) throw new ProductNotFoundException(id);

  modelAndView.addObject("product", product);
  return this.view("product/details", modelAndView);
}
```

In this example we are trying to find a **product by id**, if the product is **null**, we throw **product not found exception** with a status code of 404:
