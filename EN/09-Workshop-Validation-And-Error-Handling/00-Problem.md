# Cubicle: Part 4

[slide]

# Project Setup

"Cubicle" is a place, where you can browse some of the most popular Rubik's cubes in the world and add some new cubes that you have discovered.

This is the final part of the workshop, so if you missed some part, make sure you complete it before you continue because all parts of this workshop are related to each other.

# Main Task

As a final step you should implement some validation, notification to improve the user experience and protect the data that is stored into the database.

# Installing Dependencies

You can use [express\-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator) to do some **validation** and **sanitization** or continue using Mongoose to do validations as well.
