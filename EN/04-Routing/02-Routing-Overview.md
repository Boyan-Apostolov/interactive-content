# What is Client-Side Routing?

There are two methods for routing, **server-side** and **client-side**.

The **client-side** routing is the main element of the **Single page applications**, called **SPA**.

This routing downloads the entire app on the first load of the application.

When the URL changes, it only updates the modified component.

That is possible by the **virtual DOM**.

The **client-side** routing gives us a faster application, which benefits for better UX.

# Single Page Application

The Router will load the correct resource when the **location is changed**.

The change represents itself in the **URL**.

With this type of routing, we get many **benefits**:

- The resources are loaded only once.

- The state is maintainable across all pages.

- We access the **browser history**.

- Better and quicker UX.
