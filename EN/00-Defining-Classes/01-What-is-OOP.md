# What is OOP

**OOP** stands for **Objected-oriented programming**.

It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**.

Object-oriented programming enables programmers to think in terms of real-life entities or objects. 

## OOP vs. Procedural Programming

- **Procedural programming** is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data

- **Object-oriented programming** is about creating **objects** that contain both data and methods

## Advantages of OOP

**OOP has the following advantages:**

- **Faster** and **easier** to execute
- Provides a **clear structure** for writing programs
- Helps to keep the Java code **DRY** *"Do not Repeat Yourself"*, and makes the code **easier** to **maintain, modify and debug**
- Makes it **possible** to create completely **reusable** applications with **less code** and **shorter development time**

# When and Why Should We Use OOP

## When?

- There is a lot of code that could be shared and reused
- The project is expected to change often and be expanded over time
- We have multiple programmers who do not need to understand each component 
- Different sections can benefit from different resources like **DataSource** or **Hardware**

## Why?

- Anyone involved in software development should be familiar with **OOP** and **object-oriented modeling**
- All modern languages are either object-oriented or support classes and objects
    - Modern frameworks, libraries, and APIs are object-oriented
- Understanding of OOP is a minimum requirement for starting a job as a developer

# Search the Internet

- The course assignments require you to **search the Internet**
    - This is a major part of the learning process
    - Some exercises intentionally have no hints

- Learn to find solutions
    - Software development includes **researching and learning** new things each day
    - No excuses, simply learn how to study
    - Developers are constantly learning new technologies, tools to stay competitive in the market
