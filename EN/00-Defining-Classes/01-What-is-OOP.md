# What is OOP

**OOP** stands for **Object-oriented programming**.

As the name implies, it is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**.

Object-oriented programming enables programmers to think in terms of real-life entities or objects. 

## OOP vs. Procedural Programming

- **Procedural programming** uses procedures or methods that perform operations on the data

- **Object-oriented programming** utilizes **objects** that contain both data and methods

## Advantages of OOP

**OOP has the following advantages:**

- **Faster** and **easier** to execute
- Provides a **clear program structure**
- Helps observe the **DRY** rule:*"Do not Repeat Yourself"*, and makes the code **easier** to **maintain, modify and debug**
- Makes it **possible** to create completely **reusable** applications with **less code** and **shorter development time**

# When and Why Should We Use OOP

## When?

- When we need code that can be shared and reused
- In projects which are expected to change often and be expanded over time
- When there are programmers dealing with different parts of the code, so they do not need to understand each component 
- When we need different sections of the code to benefit from different resources like **DataSource** or **Hardware**

## Why?

- Provides powerful tools to anyone involved in software development
- All modern programming languages are either object-oriented or support classes and objects
    - modern frameworks, libraries, and APIs are object-oriented
- Understanding of OOP is one of the common requirements to start a job as a developer

# Search the Internet

- The course assignments require you to **search the Internet**
    - this is a major part of learning to code
    - some exercises intentionally have no hints

- Learn to find solutions
    - software development includes **researching and learning** new things each day
    - by doing so you will simply learn how to study coding and find answers by yourself
    - developers are constantly learning new technologies - tools to stay competitive in the market
