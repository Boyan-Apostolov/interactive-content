# What is OOP?

- **OOP** stands for **Objected-Oriented Programming**

    It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **"objects"**
- Object-Oriented programming enables programmers to think like they are working with real-life entities or objects 

## OOP vs Procedural Programming

- **Procedural Programming** is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data

**OOP has following advantiges:**

- **faster** and **easier** to execute
- provides a **clear structure** for the programs
- helps to keep the Java code **DRY** *"Don't Repeat Yourself"*, and makes the code **easier** to **maintain, modify and debug**
- makes it **possible** to create full **reusable** applications with **less code** and **shorter development time**

# When and why should we use OOP?

## When?

- There is a lot of code, that could be shared and reused
- The project is anticipated to change often and be expanded over time
- We have multiple programmers who don‘t need to understand each component 
- Different sections can benefit from different resources like **DataSource** or **Hardware**

## Why?

- Anyone involved in software development should be familiar with **OOP** and **OO** modelling
- All modern languages are either object-oriented or support classes and objects
    - Modern frameworks, libraries and APIs are object-oriented
- OOP is a basic requirement for starting a job as a developer

# Search the Internet

- The course assignments require to **search the Internet**
    - This is an important part of the learning process
    - Some exercises intentionally have no hints
- Learn to find solutions!
    - Software development includes **everyday searching and learning**
    - No excuses, just learn to study!
    - Developers learn new technologies, tools, languages every day!
