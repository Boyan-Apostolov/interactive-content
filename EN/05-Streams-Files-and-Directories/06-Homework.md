## Description
Write a program that reads a text file (**input.txt** from the Resources - Folder) and prints on the console the **sum** of the ASCII symbols of each of its lines.

Use **BufferedReader** in combination with **FileReader**.

## Guidelines

There is one zipped folder with resources for all exercises, that you need to use. 

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/java/java-advanced/04-Java-Advanced-Files-and-Streams-Exercise-Resources.zip) **that you will need.**

For each exercise submit only the **output** of your program, **not the code**.

## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| On January 1 , 1533 ,  | 1452 |
| Michael Angelo,  | 1397 |
