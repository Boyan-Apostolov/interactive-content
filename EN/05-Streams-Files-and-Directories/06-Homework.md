## Description

Write a program that reads the **input.txt** from the resources folder you downloaded, and prints the **sum** of the ASCII symbols of each of its lines to the console.

Use **BufferedReader** in combination with **FileReader**.

## Guidelines

The zip file contains all the files you will need for the rest of the tasks as well.

**Download the resources** [here](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/java/java-advanced/04-Java-Advanced-Files-and-Streams-Exercise-Resources.zip). 

For each exercise submit only the **output** of your program, **not the code**.

## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| On January 1 , 1533 ,  | 1452 |
| Michael Angelo,  | 1397 |
| then fifty-seven years old,  | 2606 |
