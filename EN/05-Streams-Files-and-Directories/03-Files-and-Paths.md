# Paths

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Advanced/07-Streams-Files-and-Directories/EN/interactive-java-advanced-streams-files-and-directories-29-Paths-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

A Java **Path** instance represents **a path in the file system**.

A path can point to either a **file** or a **directory**.

**Path** is used to **examine**, **locate**, and **manipulate** file paths and directories.

An example of that is input.txt file which we have used for the previous problems.

```java
String input = "D:\\input.txt";

Path path = Paths.get(input);
```
The static method `get()` takes a **String representation of the file location** as input.

The **instance of Path** is created by calling the `Paths.get()` method.

The Path instance gives us an easy way to create a Buffered Stream by using the BufferedReader and the **Files** class.


```java
Path path = Paths.get("D:\\input.txt");

try (BufferedReader inputStream = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {

    String line = inputStream.readLine();
    while (line != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
        line = inputStream.readLine();
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
By calling the `newBufferedReader()` method of the Files class and passing the path as an argument, the BufferedReader instance is created (**Buffered Stream**).

The following example illustrates copying the content of one file to another:

```java
Path inputPath = Paths.get("D:\\input.txt");
Path outputPath = Paths.get("D:\\output.txt");

try  {
    List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(inputPath);
    Files.write(outputPath, lines);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
First, we create two Path variables for input and output files.

Next, we call the `readallLines()` method of the Files class and pass the **inputPath** variable.

The `readAllLines()` method returns a List with all lines in a file.

Then we pass this **List** and the **outputPath** variable to the Files `write()` - method.

# Files

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Advanced/07-Streams-Files-and-Directories/EN/interactive-java-advanced-streams-files-and-directories-30-31-Files-1-2-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The Files class provides methods for manipulating files.


This class is used for the creation of files and directories, file searching, file deletion, etc.

- Creating a File object by placing the String representation of the file location in the constructor:


```java
File file = new File("D:\\input.txt");

try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
    // Do operations on a file
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

Here are a few useful **methods** of provided by the **Files** and **Paths** classes:

| **Method** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Files.exists()**| Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists. Returns true if and only if the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists; false otherwise. |
| **Paths.get()** | Gets the path of the resource from a single string of from a sequence a string that can be joined together to form the complete path.|
| **Files.readAllLines()** | Read all lines from a file. |
| **Files.write(outputPath, content)** | Writes the content to a file. |

```Java
Path inPath = Paths.get("D:\\input.txt");
Path outPath = Paths.get("D:\\output.txt");

List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(inPath);
Files.write(outPath, lines);
```

[task-description]
## Description

Read the "**input.txt**" file from the resources that you downloaded previously. 

Write the text to **another txt file**.

Use the **Paths** and **Files** Classes.

## Guidelines

You should already have all the required resources downloaded from a previous task.

Submit only the **output** of your program, **not the code**.


## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| C | A |
| A | B |
| B | C |
| D | D |
