Now we take a look into a commonly used instrument that can help us find errors in our code: **the debugger**.

## What is "Debugging"?
**Debugging** is the process that allows us to **track the execution of a program step by step**. 

It allows us to track what happens in our program **line by line**, what logic it follows, what are the values of the variables at each step of execution, and many other elements that allow us to detect errors (**bugs**).

# Debugging in IntelliJ IDEA 

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/02-conditional-statements/EN/interactive-programming-basics-with-java-conditional-statements-32-34-debugging-demo-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

By pressing the `[Shift + F9]` button, we run the program in **debug mode**. 

We move to **the next line** with `[F7]`.

With `[Ctrl + F8]` we place **breakpoints**, that we can reach directly using `[Ctrl + F8]` when we start the program.
