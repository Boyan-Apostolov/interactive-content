# What is Client-Side Routing?

We have two methods for routing, **server\-side**, and **client\-side**.

The **client\-side** routing is the main element of the **Single page applications**, also called **SPA**.

This routing downloads the entire app on the first load.

And When the URL changes, it only updates the component, which is different.

This is possible by the virtual DOM.

The **client\-side** routing gives us a faster application, which benefits for better UX.

# Single Page Application

When the location is changed, the router will load the correct resource.

This location change will be represented in the URL.

With this type of routing, we get many benefits.

Some of them are:

-  The resources for the app are load only once.

-  The state is maintainable across all pages.

-  We can use **browser history**.

-  Fast UI.
