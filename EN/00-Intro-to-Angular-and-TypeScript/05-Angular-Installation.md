To install **Angular CLI**, we need to write the following command in the terminal: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

This command will install **Angular CLI** globally.

When the installation is complete, we are **ready to create our first project**.

To create a project, we need to write in the terminal **ng new** and the app name.

It looks like this: `ng new some-app`.

After we have **created the project**, we can navigate to it with `cd some-app`.

To run the application, we need to start a server with `ng serve`.

By default, it will run on **port 4200**.

You can find more information on [Official Website](https://angular.io) or at the [documentation](https://angular.io/docs).

# IDE Support

Intro-to-Angular-and-Typescript-25-IDE-Support

Most of the modern **IDEs** support TypeScript or have **plugins** that we can install.

For example, **Visual Studio Code** fully supports TypeScript, **without the need for any plugins**.

When using VSCode for writing Angular, the "**Angular Language Service**" extension could be installed, which will **help to receive IntelliSense when binding class properties** or **components into HTML files**.

Also, with **Angular CLI**, **everything** is included.

We do not need to use **linter** or to install any other **plugins**.
