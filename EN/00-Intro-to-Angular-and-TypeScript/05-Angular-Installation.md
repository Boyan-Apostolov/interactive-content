# Angular Installation

# Create a New App

To install **Angular CLI**, we need to write the following command: `npm install -g @angular/cli `.

This command will install it globally.

After the installation, we are ready to create our first project.

To do that, we need to write in the terminal **ng new** and the app name.

It looks like this: `ng new some-app`.

After the project is created, we can navigate to it with `cd some-app`.

To run the application, we need to start a server with `ng serve`.

By default, it will run on port 4200.

You can find more information on [Official Website](https://angular.io/https://angular.io/) or at the [documentation](https://angular.io/docs).

# IDE Support

Most of the modern IDEs support TypeScript or have **plugins** that we can install.

For example, **Visual Studio Code** fully supports TypeScript, without the need for any plugins.

Also, with **Angular CLI**, **everything** is included.

We do not need to use **linter** or to install any **plugins**.
