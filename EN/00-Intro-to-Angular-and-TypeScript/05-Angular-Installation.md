To install the **Angular CLI**, we can type in the following command in a terminal: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Note, that this command will install **Angular CLI** globally.

When the installation is complete, we are **ready to create our first project**.

To create a project, we need to type in: **ng new** and the app name in the terminal.

Example: `ng new some-app`.

After we have **created a project**, we can navigate to it using `cd some-app`:

The "cd" command stands for "change directory" and it should be followed by the folder name of our newly created project.

To run the application, we need to start a server by typing in `ng serve`.

By default, it will run on **port 4200**.

You can find more information on [Official Website](https://angular.io) or at the official [documentation](https://angular.io/docs).

Most modern **IDEs** support TypeScript or have **plugins** that we can install.

For example, **Visual Studio Code** fully supports TypeScript, **with no need for additional plugins**.

When using VSCode for Angular, the "**Angular Language Service**" extension can be installed, which will **initialize IntelliSense when binding class properties** or **components into HTML files**.

**Angular CLI**, comes with all these tools preinstalled.

We do not need to use **linter** or to install any other **plugins**.
