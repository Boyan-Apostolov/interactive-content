# What is Routing?

**Routing** is navigation on the **client-side**.

The **client-side routing** is the main element of the **Single Page Applications**, also called **SPA**.

This navigation downloads the entire app on the first load.

And When the URL changes, it only updates the page without **reloading**.

Unlike the **server-side** navigation, which reloads on every **change** in the URL.

Here is the difference between the two types of navigation:

-  **Server-Side**:

-  **Client-Side**:

# Single Page Application

When the **location is changed**, the **router** will load the correct resource for that location.

Also, in reverse, a difference in the content will be represented in the URL

This type of routing has many benefits.

Some of them are:

-  The resources for the app are load **only once**.

-  The state is maintainable across all pages.

-  We can use **browser history**.

-  Fast **UI**.
