The following REST services will be created automatically to access your data:

- **List All Books**
   - endpoint: `https://[:projectId].firebaseio.com/books.json`
   - method: **GET**
   - headers: Basic Authorization with user credentials
   - returns (JSON)

- **Create a New Book**
   - endpoint: `https://[:projectId].firebaseio.com/books.json`
   - method: **POST**
   - headers: Basic Authorization with user credentials and content-type application\/json
   - request body (JSON): `{"title":"…", "author":"…", "isbn":"…"}`

- **Update a Book**
   - endpoint: `https://[:project-id].firebaseio.com/books/[:bookId].json`
   - method: **PUT**
   - headers: Basic Authorization with user credentials and content-type `application/json`
   - request body (JSON): `{"title":"…", "author":"…", "isbn":"…"}`

- **Delete a Book**
   - endpoint: `https://[:project-id].firebaseio.com/books/[:bookId].json`
   - method: **DELETE**
   - headers: Basic Authorization with user credentials and content-type `application/json`

Test your REST Service using **Postman**. 

Try to list all of the books in a **JSON format** with an **HTTP GET request** to the **REST API**.

## List All Books

Use the skeleton provided in the resources folder. 

Add an **AJAX** call that takes all of the books from your application as a JSON object and **displays** them when the page loads.

## Create a Book

Adds an **HTML form** with a `[Submit]` **button** for adding a new book. 

When the button is **pressed**, create a new book using its **REST API** with an **AJAX request**.

## Edit a Book

Implement "**Edit a Book**" functionality. 

Clicking on a book should **load its data** on an **HTML form**. 

By **clicking** the `[Edit]` button, the **book data** should be **updated** on the **server** with an **AJAX request**.

## Delete a Book

Implement "**Delete a Book**" functionality. 

Each book should have a `[Delete]` button. 

Clicking on it should **delete the book at the server** side with an AJAX request.

## Add Tags for Each Book

Implement **tags** for the books. 

Tags should be stored in the Book collection in a column "**tags**" as **array of strings**. 

List the tags for each book. 

Implement **add** \/ **edit** \/ **delete** for tags when a book is **created** \/ **updated**.

# Problem: Students

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/JS-Applications-Remote-Databases-Homework-STUDENTS.zip) **for this task.**

Create functionalities for creating and listing students from a database.

Create a new collection called "**students**".

Each student has a/an:

- **Id** - a **number**, non-empty
- **FirstName** - a **string**, non-empty
- **LastName** - a **string**, non-empty
- **FacultyNumber** - a **string of numbers**, non-empty
- **Grade** - a **number**, non-empty

When creating a new student, make sure you name the properties accordingly.

Create at least one student to test your code.

You should also need to extract the students.

The given **HTML template** contains a table in it.

Create an **AJAX request** that extracts all of the students.

Upon fetching all of the students from the database, add them to a table each on a new row **sorted in ascending order by ID**.

**Use the skeleton from the provided resources.**

# Problem: Wild Wild West

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/JS-Applications-Remote-Databases-Homework-WILD-WILD-WEST.zip) **for this task.**

**This task is not included in the final result**.

Write **REST services** for a simple Western game.

Create a collection called "players". Each player having a **name**, **money**, and **bullets** to hold information about the players in the game.

- **Name** - a **string** representing the name of the current player
- **Money** - an **integer** number representing the current player's money
- **Bullets** - an **integer** number representing the current bullets of the player

## HTML and JS

The project skeleton contains an **HTML template** and **JS files**.

The "**loadCanvas.js**" is a simple implementation for the game and your job is to **attach events** to all of the buttons and make the needed **AJAX requests**.

When the page is loaded, a **GET** request should be sent to the server to get all of the players and load them in the div with ID **players**.

An example entry is left in the HTML to demonstrate the representation of a player and their placement.

Whenever the `[Save]` button is pressed, the progress of the current player, if any should be saved.

Use a **PUT** request to update the data on the server:

- The **canvas** and the `[Save]` and `[Reload]` buttons should be hidden
- The **clearInterval** should be called on the "**canvas.intervarId**" property used for the main loop of the game

Whenever the `[Reload]` button is pressed, the player's money should be **reduced by 60** and their bullets should be **set to 6**.

Whenever the `[Add Player]` button is pressed, a new Player with the specified name, should be created and the players should be displayed with the newly created player.

Each new player **starts** with **500 Money** and **6 bullets**.

Pressing the `[Play]` button on a player should:

- Call the `[Save]` button
- Display the **canvas**, `[Save]` and `[Reload]` buttons
- Call the `loadCanvas()` function from the "**loadCanvas.js**" file
- Pass to it the **new player** as an **object**, containing those properties name, money, and bullets

When a player's `[Delete]` button is pressed, the player should be deleted, both from the HTML and the server.
