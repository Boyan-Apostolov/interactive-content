# In this lesson you learnt:

- **Design patterns:** proven approaches to common software problems that allow us to benefit from the knowledge and experience of other programmers who have over time come up with different patterns

- Remember: **design patterns** are not concrete solutions and need to be implemented on a case by case basis after comparing their benefits and consequences from their use

- **Categories of design patterns:**
    - Creational: focus on object creation mechanisms
    - Behavioral: improve communication between dissimilar objects
    - Structural: deal with object and class composition
