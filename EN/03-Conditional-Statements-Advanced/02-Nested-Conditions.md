# Nested Conditions

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/03-conditional-statements-advanced/EN/interactive-programming-basics-with-java-conditional-statements-advanced-9-10-11-nested-conditional-statements-and-demo-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Often, program logic requires the use of `if` or `if-else` statements, which are contained one inside another.  
These are called **nested** statements. 

As implied by the word **"nested"**, these are `if` or `if-else` statements that are placed inside other `if` or `else` statements.

```java
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // body; 
    } else {
        // body;
    }
}
```

## Example: Personal Titles
Depending on someones **age** (integer) and their **gender** (**m** / **f**), print their personal title:
-  "Mr." - a man (gender "m") - 16 or older
-  "Master" - a boy (gender "m") - under 16 years old
-  "Ms." - a woman (gender "f") â€“ 16 or molder
-  "Miss" - a girl (gender "f") - under 16 years old

## Solution: Personal Titles
We should notice that the **output** of the program **depends on a few conditions**. 

**First**, we have to check what their **gender** is and **then** their **age**. 

We are going to use **a few** `if-else` blocks. 

These blocks will be **nested**, so that by **the result** of the outer one, we are going to **define** which one of the **inner ones** to execute.

After reading the input data from the console, the following program logic should be executed:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int age = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
String gender = scanner.nextLine();

if (age < 16) {
    if (gender == "m") {
        System.out.println("Master");
    } else if (gender == "f") {
        System.out.println("Miss");
    }
} else {
    if (gender == "m") {
        System.out.println("Mr.");
    } else if (gender == "f") {
        System.out.println("Ms.");
    }
}
```

## Deep nesting
Nesting **more than three levels of conditional statements** is not considered a good practice.

We can optimize the code structure by using another type of conditional statement.
