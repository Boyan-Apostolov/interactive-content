A market offers different prices for their products based on the day of the week.

|Product|Weekday|Weekend| 
|-------|-------|-------|
|Banana|2.50|2.70|
|Apple|1.30|1.60|
|Kiwi|2.20|3.00|

We want to calculate the price for certain product and day.

# Pseudocode

```
Read the input 
If we want to buy a banana
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.50
  Otherwise the price is 2.70
If the product is an apple
  If it is a weekday the price is 1.30
  Otherwise the price is 1.60
If the product is a kiwi
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.20
  Otherwise the price is 3.00
