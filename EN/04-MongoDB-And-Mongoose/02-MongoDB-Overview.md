# Configure MongoDB

When installed, additional configurations will be needed.

- Go to the installation folder and **run** a command prompt as an **administrator**.

- Type the following command:

```
<path to mongod.exe> mongod --dbpath <path to store data>
```

Usually, in `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin`

# Working with MongoDB GUI

Many MongoDB graphical user interfaces help developers to manage their databases.

For this lesson, we will not dive deep into the comparison between different interfaces.

The most popular GUI's are:

- [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download)

- [NoSQLBooster](https://nosqlbooster.com)

- [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/)

You can choose one that matches your project at most.

# Working with MongoDB from Node.js

Here is a simple example of how to connect with MongoDB using Node.js

``` js
const mongodb = require('mongodb');
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;
const connectionStr = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(connectionStr);
client.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) { throw new Error(err) }
  const db = client.db('testdb');
  const people = db.collection('people');
  people.insert({ 'name': 'John' }, (err, result) => {
    people.find({ name: 'John' }).toArray((err, data) => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  });
});
```

First, we import MongoClient and set our connection string. 

After that, that we have a connection string, we can create an instance of MongoClient.

The last step is to make a function that would collect our info about the people inside.
