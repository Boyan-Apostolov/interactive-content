# Pre Middleware

**Middleware** is functions that are passed control during the execution of asynchronous functions.

They are executed before or after a certain function that we specify.

- **Pre Middleware**

**Pre middleware** functions are executed one after another. 

We use them when:

- We have a **complex validation**

- To **remove** dependent documents

- When we have **asynchronous** tasks that a certain action **triggers**

As the name suggests, **pre middlewares** get executed **before** some other method execution on some documents.

``` js
const schema = new Schema(..);
schema.pre('save', function() { 
  return hashPassword()
    .then(() => validateData());
  });
```

# Post Middleware

**Post middleware** is executed once all the **pre-hooks** have been executed and after the original method has been executed.


`pre-hooks -> method -> post-hooks`


An example would help:

``` js
const schema = new Schema(..);

schema.post('save', function(doc) { 
  console.log('It has been saved', doc._id); 
}); 

schema.post('remove', function(doc) { 
  console.log('It has been removed', doc._id); 
});
```
