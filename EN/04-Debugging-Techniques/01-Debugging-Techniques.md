# What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of locating and fixing or bypassing bugs (errors) in computer program code.

To debug a program, a user has to start with a problem.

After that, the user needs to isolate the source code that is causing problems (bugs).

The last step is knowing how to fix the bug, as knowledge about problem analysis is expected.

**Debugging tools** (called **debuggers**) help identify coding errors at various development stages.

Programmers can trace the execution of the whole program step-by-step getting the value of the needed variables on every execution step.

Debugging, you also have the power to change and test the behavior of your code without modifying the source.

# Debugging vs. Testing

- Testing means that programmers must test the execution flow of the program, then detect if an initial error occurs.

- Debugging is the process of diagnosing and correcting the root causes of errors that have already been detected.

# Importance of Debugging

Debugging is an important procedure whether a business item or a venture or individual's applications developing is involved.

Knowing how to debug properly saves precious development time and also helps you understand your code's logic and flow system better.

Debugging and finding defects will save additional time and resources, also it will help you train your logical and analytical understanding.

This is one of the reasons, companies hire consultants.

# Debugging Philosophy

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Advanced/06-Debugging-Techniques/EN/Java-Advanced-Debugging-Techniques-7-debugging-philosophy-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**Debugging** can be viewed as one big decision tree.

- Individual nodes represent **theories**
- Leaf nodes represent possible **root causes**
- Traversal of tree boils down to process state **inspection**
- Minimizing time to resolution is **key**
    - careful traversal of the decision tree
    - pattern recognition
    - visualization and ease of use helps minimize time to resolution
