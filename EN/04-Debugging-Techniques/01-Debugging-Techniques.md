# What is Debugging?

The process of locating an **error** (**bug**) and after that fixing it, we call **Debugging**.

There are a few steps that we have to follow when we are **debugging** a program:

- We have to identify the **problem**

- Next, we can isolate the **source** of the problem

- Next we have found and isolate it, the next step is to  **fix** the problem

Luckily, there are **Debugging tools** that help us to locate the bugs.

The **Debugging tools** are also called **debuggers**.

# Debugging vs. Testing

There is a difference between **Testing** and **Debugging**.

**Testing** is the process of confirming if the software has bugs.

We test the application to make sure that it works as it is supposed to work.

We debug the application after it has failed. 

**Debugging** is done to fix the error found during the testing.

The **debugging** cannot be **automated**, unlike the **testing** which can be **automated** or **manual**.

The **debugging** can only be **manual**.

The **testing** is done by a tester, while the **debugging** can be done by a programmer.

# Importance of Debugging

**Debugging** is one of the most important steps when developing an application.

Because there are factors that are not predictable or we cannot control.

In other words, there is no such thing as perfect code.

There are many legacy projects written before many years.

In scenarios like this one, we have to orientate quickly.

The debugging will help to understand the project in depth.

**Interesting fact** is that, bugs cause about $60 Billion per year in economic losses.

An example is the [Cluster Spacecraft Failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(spacecraft)#Launch_failure).

# Debugging Philosophy

We can imagine that the **debugging** is a tree.

The different branches represent independent **theories**.

Every one of these branches is a potential error.

The leaves on the branches are the potential causes of the bug.

When we traverse the tree, we process the information that it stores.

Every action consumes time, but there is a way to reduce the time consumed, for example:

- Visualization

- Traverse the code carefully

- Using a [recognition pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition)
