# Summary

# In this lesson you learned:

-  **Strings** are an immutable series of **characters**

-  They have built-in methods that we use to process them, some of them are

   -  `concat()`

   ```js
   let str = 'Hello, ';
   let concatenated = str.concat('John!');
   ```

   -  `split()`

   ```js
   let str = 'Hello, John';
   let spitted = str.split(', ');
   ```

   -  `includes()`

   ```js
   let str = 'Hello, John';
   let include = str.includes('John');
   ```

-  Most of the methods return a new string
