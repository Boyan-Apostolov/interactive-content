## What you learned in this lesson

-  **Strings** are an immutable series of **characters**
-  They have built-in methods that we use to process them. Some of them are :
   -  `concat()`
   ```js live     
   let str = "Hello, "
   console.log(str.concat("John!"))
   ```

   -  `split()`
   ```js live
   let str = "Hello, John"
   console.log(str.split(", "))
   ```

   -  `includes()`
   ```js live
   let str = "Hello, John"
   console.log(str.includes("John"))
   ```

-  Most of the methods returns a new string.
