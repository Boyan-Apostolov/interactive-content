# Types of Errors

Wen we have errors in our app, we have to handle them properly.

The types of errors are:

-  **Technical** or **Network** errors.

   -  An example of **technical** or **network** error is when the server is down.

-  **Usual** or **Expected** errors are the predictable ones.

   -  Example of **usual** or **expected** is when a database operation fails or cannot read a file.

-  **Bugs** or **Logical** errors are not predictable because, with these errors, the software does not work how we expected.

   -  Example of **bugs** or **logical** is trying to call something that does not exist.

   -  Also, these errors are our fault, and we should fix them through the development process.
