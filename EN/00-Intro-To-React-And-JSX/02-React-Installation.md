# Create React App

Developed by Facebook, `Create-React-App` is a command line tool, that enables bootstrapping a **React** project in seconds.

Using `create-react-app` enables a number of benefits:

- Once you **save a change** in your codebase, React automatically **recompiles** your app and **reloads the page** instantly, resulting in less waiting time.

- Under the hood, it uses **Babel** and **webpack**, which it takes care of by itself.

- Deploying to production is a easy as running the `npm run build` command.

# Install and Run the React App Creator

Let us create our first React application.

First open a terminal instance in a directory of your choice.

Make sure you have Node.js installed by typing `node -v`.

If you do not have Node.js, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then, in the command-line window type `npx create-react-app my-app` and press [Enter].

You can replace `my-app` with any name you want for your app directory.

The `npx` syntax is not a mistake.

Included with NPM 5.2 and above, it makes sure you always run the most up-to-date version of a given package.

After installation finishes, go to the newly created directory by typing `cd my-app`.

To start your React application, type in `npm start`.

This will open a development version of your project in your default browser.

In case it does not open, just click [this link](http://localhost:3000) or open your browser of choice and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

# React App Structure

React applications typically consist of many files.

This is what a typical file tree looks like:

Here are some of the most important files and what they do:

- `package.json`: Stores the project configuration
  - Names and version numbers of all dependencies
  - Build actions that can be ran from a terminal instance

- `index.html`: The main HTML file of our app
  - The `div` with `id="main"` is typically what React uses to output components

- `index.js`: This file takes care of our startup script
  - Here we also define which HTML element to use for rendering

**React Component file structure**:

Let us take a look at the `App` component.

- `App.js`: Stores the component logic

- `App.css`: Contains all the styles, related to the given component

- `App.test.js`: Used when testing the component functionality
