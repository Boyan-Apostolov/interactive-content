# MySQL

MySQL is a free software under the **GNU General Public License** and is also available under different proprietary licenses. 

It was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company **MySQL AB**, bought by **Sun Microsystems** and now called **Oracle Corporation**.

Many database-driven web applications use MySQL, including **Drupal**, **Joomla**, **phpBB**, and **WordPress**.

MySQL is used by many popular websites, some of which are **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **YouTube**.

It works on many system platforms, including **Windows**, **MAC OS**, and **Linux**.

Here are some links for downloading MySQL Server:

# MySQL Server Architecture

The MySQL server architecture isolates the application programmer and DBA from all low-level implementation details at the storage level, providing a consistent application model and API. 

–êlthough there are different capabilities across different storage engines, the application is shielded from these differences. 

The MySQL storage engine architecture enables us to select a specialized storage engine for a particular application need while being completely shielded from the need to manage any specific application coding requirements. 

In the logical storage, we have instances, each consisting of a database with its tables.

In the physical storage, we have data files and logs.

# Database Table Elements

The table is the building block of any database. 

Each table row is called a record or an entity, and each column defines the type of data they contain.

Additionally, in a relational database such as MySQL, we have **primary** keys and **secondary** keys, which we use to define the relationship between the tables.

In the following example, we have the `Customer` table with a **primary key** `customer_id` and a **secondary** key `city_id`.

This **secondary** key references the **primary** key in the `City` table.
