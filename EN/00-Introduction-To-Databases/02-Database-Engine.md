The server in a client-server model is simply the **DBMS**, and the client is the database application serviced by the **DBMS**.

We have distributed client-servers when the client is on one computer while the server and database are on another. 

That is called **client-server model**.

The connection between the client and the server is made over **TCP/IP** - **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**.

TCP is responsible for **transferring data** in small packages, and the IP is responsible for sending data from one IP address to another.

Here are some of the default ports used by databases:

- 3306 - Used by **MySQL**
- 1433 - Used by **Microsoft SQL Server**
- 1521 - Used by **Oracle**

MySQL has many clients: **HeidiSQL**, **MySQL Workbench**, etc.
