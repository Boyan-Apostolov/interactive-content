**Chrome DevTools** is a set of tools that are built into the Chrome browser.

We can access the DevTools by pressing `F12` on the keyboard - for Windows/Linux, and `Command+Option+I` - for Mac.

To see the server **response**, we have to go to the **Network** tab and choose the **request** we want.

Here is how it looks:

As you can see, there are multiple tabs - each with a different set of functionalities.

You can use the **Network** panel to make sure resources are being delivered properly.

Or, use the **Console** panel to log messages and run scripts.

You can learn more about the DevTools [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).

**Postman** gives us the ability to test an API.

With this tool, we can send **requests** and **receive** responses, without **writing code** or using the browser.

As you can see below, Postman has a graphical UI, making it ideal for testing:
