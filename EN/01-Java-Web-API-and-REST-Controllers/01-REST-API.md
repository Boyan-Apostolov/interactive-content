# RESTful Design

An API, short for Application Programming Interface, is a software intermediary that allows us to access third-party functionality in our applications,

A RESTful API follows specific architectural constraints, such as abstracting the underlying third-party logic from developers.

While REST is not an official protocol or standard, RESTful APIs tend to have similar structure conventions, request/response payload structure, and error handling.

APIs can be accessed through different communication protocols.

They are most often accessed over HTTPS, and accept JSON both as a request and response payload.
