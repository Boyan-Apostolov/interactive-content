# Origami Platform Workshop: Part 4

[slide]
# Overview

Last time we have to implement **private**, **public**, and make the already created **forms work**. 

If you missed some of these parts, **go back and complete them before you continue.**

- Once we have **authentication** in our app. 

The next step is to **protect the routes**

   - If a guest user tries to access some of the **private parts**, he should be **redirected** to the publications or **404 page.**

   - If some of them **already logged** **in user tries to access the public parts**, he should be **redirected** to the publications or **404 page.**

- Refactor **all class components** to **functional components** that work with **hooks.**

# Public Parts

These parts can be accessed by any **guest user** (not logged in).

- **Publications**

Publications view **shows all created posts** from the database.

A register form should make a post request with the given data to the API and create a user.

- **Login**

The login form should also make a **post request** with the given data to the **API**, and if the **provided data** is valid, you should authorize the user (**can see the public parts**).

- **Profile**

The profile page **shows** information about the currently logged-in user. 

This is his **username**, **total posts count** and the **top 3 of his recent posts.** 

Also, you should show a `[Logout]` **button**, which can be pressed and clear the **provided jwt** token from the API and redirect the user to the **publications page.**

- **Post**

In the Post view, the form with the text area should be able to make a **post request** with the given **post description.** 

If that happens, the user should be redirected to the **publication view.**

Also, this view shows the **top 3 recent posts** from the database.
