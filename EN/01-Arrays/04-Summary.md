# Summary

What we learned in this lesson: 

- Arrays are sequences of elements 

    - Their elements are numbered from `0` to `length-1 `

- We can create an array using this syntax: `let arr = [5,3,7]` 

- We can access its elements by their index: `arr[2] = 4`

- Elements can be iterated over with a standard loop or a `for-of` loop
