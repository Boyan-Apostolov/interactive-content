# Resources and Overview 

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/java/Java-Spring-Fundamentals/Java-Spring-Fundamentals-Exam-Preparation-ShoppingList-Resources.zip) **for this task.**

**Shopping List Application** is here to help us keep in mind our shopping needs. 

The functionality is simple. 

When a user thinks of something important, they log in and add it to existing ones. 

So when a person goes to the store, they have a clear idea of exactly what to buy.  

So our little app saves a lot of family scandals.

There are several requirements you must follow in the implementation:

The templates have been given to you in the application skeleton, so make sure you implement the pages correctly. 

**NOTE**: The templates should look EXACTLY as shown above.

**NOTE**: The templates do **NOT require additional CSS** for you to write. 

Only **bootstrap** and the **given CSS** are enough.

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

The **Functionality Requirements** describe the functionality that the **Application** must support.

The **application** should provide **Guest** (not logged in) users with the functionality to **login**, **register** and **view** the **Index** page.

The application should provide **Users** (logged in) with the functionality to **logout**, **add a Product**, **view all Products (Home page)** and **Buy a single one** from products or **Buy All** products.

**Shopping List App** in navbar should redirect to appropriate **URL depending** on that if the user is logged in.
