# Interfaces

`Interfaces` in Java may look like a **class**, but they are not classses. 

An **interface** can have all the methods and variables like the class do, but the **methods** in the interface are **abstract** by default.

**Interfaces** in Java are used to specify a behavior that **classes** must **implement**.

We use **interfaces** when we want to achieve **security**.

As we know, Java does not support "**multiple inheritance**". However, we can achieve this easy with **interfaces**, because the class can **implement** multiple interfaces.
