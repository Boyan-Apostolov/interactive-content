# Interfaces vs Abstract Classes

Once again, lets see the main differences between `Interfaces` and `Abstract` classes.

From that chart we can assume that we can use `interfaces` when we need to achieve **multiple inheritance**, **full abstraction** by implementing all methods declared in the interface by a class which implements the interface.

We use `abstraction` when some classes need to share few lines of code. We can put these lines of code in an abstract class and extend by all other related classes.
