Having familiarised ourselves with the structure of a **for-loop** 

the next step would be to examine under what circumstances an **infinite for-loop** occurs and how to utilize it.

An **infinite for-loop** never reaches its exit condition; consequently, repeats indefinitely

Here is what a **for-loop** with no exit condition might look like:
```java
for ( ; ; ) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

In coding terms, an **infinite loop** is a looping construct that does not terminate. 

Sometimes it may be the result of a programming error - the exit conditions are incorrectly placed and cannot be reached. 

Therefore, pay close attention to the loop **exit conditions** in order not to cause one unintentionally.
