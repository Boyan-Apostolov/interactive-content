# Infinite Loops

Now that we know about the **for-loop** and its structure, 

we will see what an **infinite loop** is and when it occurs.

An **infinite loop** is a loop that **repeats infinitely**. 

An infinite **for-loop** occurs when there is **no condition to end the loop**.

Here is what a **for-loop** with no exit condition might look like:
```java live
for ( ; ; ) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

Usually, it is the result of a programming error - for example, when the exit conditions are incorrectly placed. 

An infinite loop is usually not dangerous but be annoying when it occurs.

So we have to be careful not to cause one by accident.
