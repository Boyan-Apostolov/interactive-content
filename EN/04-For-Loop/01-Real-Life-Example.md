# Real-Life Example: Moving Dishes
Imagine that you have to load the dishwasher with some dishes from the sink. 

[image assetsSrc="04.For-Loop-Real-Life-Example-Dishes.png" /]

In this case, let us say that you can see exactly **how many dishes there are in the sink.** 

You should not stop loading the dishwasher until you have moved all of them. 

So, you will pick up t**he first one and put it in the dishwasher.** 

Then you will pick up the **second one** and put it in the dishwasher and continue repeating the same action until you put all dishes from the sink in the dishwasher. 

You will repeat this particular action a certain number of times, (and you know exactly how many times before starting the process).
