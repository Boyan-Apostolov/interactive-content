# Additional Pages

You should implement four new routes:

- `/login`: should render the login form

- `/register`: should render the register form

- `/edit`: should render the edit form

- `/delete`: should render the delete form

Make sure when you access `/edit` and `/delete` routes, they show the current cube information.

Use the provided resources to create the additional templates using Handlebars (Use **username**: **student**, **password**: **student credentials** to do that).

Identify the dynamic parts and use appropriate syntax for interpolating and rendering the application context. Replace the old CSS file with the given one.
