# Relational Schema

After we finish creating the database and its entities, we can view them and their relations using a tool named **E/R Diagram**.

Integrated into MySQL Workbench, it creates a **Relational schema** of all the entities in the database. 

The relational schemas describe the structure of our database.

**It visualizes:**

- The schemas of all tables

- The relations between tables

- Any other database object (e. g. - constraints)

- It contains only **metadata**, no entity records
