# Description
Create a program that calculates the cost of drinks, that a customer has bought from a coffee machine:

|   | **Without sugar** | **Normal** | **Extra sugar** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Espresso | 0.90$ | 1$ | 1.20$ |
| Cappuccino | 1.00$ | 1.20$ | 1.60$ |
| Tea | 0.50$ | 0.60$ | 0.70$ |

Keep in mind the following discounts:
- There is a 35% discount if the selected drink should **not** contain **sugar**
- There is a 25% discount if 5 cups of Espresso have been purchased
- There is a 20% discount from the total bill, if it exceeds 15$

The discounts are applied in the order of their description.

## Input
You will receive **3 lines of input**:
- The first line will hold the type of drink - **a string**: "**Espresso**", "**Cappuccino**" or "**Tea**" 
- The second line will regard the sugar level - **a string**: "**Without**", "**Normal**" or "**Extra**" 
- The third line will specify the number of drinks - **an integer** in rangeâ€¯[1 ... 50] 

## Output
Print **a single line** to the console:
- "**You bought** \{**count drinks**\} **cups of** \{**drink**\} **for** \{**total price**\} **dollars.**"
The price must be formatted up to **the second decimal place**.

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Espresso | You bought 10 cups of Espresso for 4.39 dollars. |
| Without |  |
| 10 |  |
