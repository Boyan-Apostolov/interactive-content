# Description

You will be given an integer **n** for the **size** of the bee territory with **square** shape. 

On the next **n** lines, you will receive the **rows** of the territory. 

The bee will be placed on a **random position**, marked with the letter **'B'**. 

On random positions there will be flowers, marked with **'f'**. 

There may also be а **bonus** on the territory. 

There will always be only one bonus. 

It will be **marked** with the **letter** - **'O'**. 

**All of the empty positions** will be marked with '.'. 

Each turn, you will be given **command** for the **bee’s movement**. 

The commands will be: **"up"**, **"down"**, **"left"**, **"right"**, **"End"**. 

If the bee **moves** to a **flower**, it pollinates the flower and increase pollinated flowers with one. 

If it goes to a **bonus**, the bee gets a bonus one move forward and then the bonus **disappears**. 

If the bee **goes out** she can't return back and the program ends. If the bee receive **"End"** command the program ends. 

The bee needs **at least 5 pollinated flowers**. 

## Input

- On the first line, you are given the integer **n** – the size of the **square** matrix. 

- The **next n lines** holds the values for every **row**. 

- On each of the next lines until you receive **"End"** command,  you will receive a move command. 

## Output

- On the first line:
  - If the bee goes out of its territory print: **"The bee got lost!"**
- On the second line:
  - If the bee couldn’t pollinate enough flowers print: **"The bee couldn't pollinate the flowers, she needed** \{**needed**\} **flowers more"**
  - If the bee successfully pollinated enough flowers print: **"Great job, the bee manage to pollinate** \{**polinationed flowers**\} **flowers!"**
- In the end print the matrix.

## Constraints

- The size of the **square** matrix will be between \[2…10\]. 

- There will **always** be **0** or **1** bonus, marked with - **'O'**. 

- The bee position will be marked with **'B'**. 

- There won't be a case where a bonus moves the bee out of its territory.
