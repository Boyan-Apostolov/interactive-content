# What are React Hooks?

**React Hooks** is a pretty new feature in React.

They arrived at the **React 16.8** version.

**React Hooks** are functions that can be used only in function components.

They let us use state or context without writing classes.

Hooks have a naming convention that we need to observe.

They start with **use**, and after that is the name of the function.

For example:

- `useState()`

- `useContext()`

- `useEffect()`

The main idea is to use the class functionality into functions components.

Like **managing state** and **adding lifecycle methods**.

Hooks are made to be **highly re-usable** and independent.

So this means that we can **share functionality**, but we **cannot** share data between components.

Also, hooks are **not** lifecycle methods.

We **cannot** replace them with hooks, but we can **simulate** them.
