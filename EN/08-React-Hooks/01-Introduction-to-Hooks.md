The **React Hooks** is a new feature in **React**.

They arrived at the **16.8** version of **React**.

The main idea of **React Hooks** is to use the **class** functionality in **functional components**.

They let us to **manage the state** and **add lifecycle methods** to the application **without** writing **class components**.

That means that we can use them only in **functional components**.

**Hooks** have a naming convention that we need to follow.

They start with **use**, and after that is the name of the function.

For example:

- `useState()`

- `useContext()`

- `useEffect()`

Hooks are made to be **highly re-usable** and independent.

That means that we can **share functionality**, but we **cannot** share data between components.

We **cannot** replace the **lifecycle methods** with hooks, but we can **simulate** them.
