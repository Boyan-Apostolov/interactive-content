# What is Routing?

Angular-Modules-and-routing-8-9-What-is-Routing

**Routing** is navigation on the **client-side**, which is the main element of **Single Page Applications**, also called **SPA**s.

This type of navigation downloads the entire app on the first load, and if the URL changes, it only updates the page without **reloading**.

There is also **server-side** navigation, which works differently than **client-side** navigation.

**Server-side** navigation reloads on every **change** in the URL.

In this example you can notice the difference between the two types of navigation:

## Server-Side

First, the user clicks on an **anchor** element and the browser detects the event.

Then, the client creates a **GET** request to route found in the `href` tag.

On the **server** side, the request is processed and a response (in the form of HTML, JSON, images, etc.) is returned.

Finally, the browser loads a completely **new webpage**, discarding the previous one.

## Client-Side

Once again, the browser detects a click event, but a **client-side routing library** handles it.

It detects that the URL is in the form of a **path** (e.g. `'/users/jane.michaels`) and does **not** perform a GET request.

The library then modifies the current URL using the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API), and changes the **state** of the given component.

A front-end framework (such as Angular) **processes** state changes and **renders** the required **components**.

If new information is required, it **fetches** it in small chunks.

Instead of downloading a whole webpage, Angular will download **only** the new assets, and will **generate** the client-ready HTML **locally**.

# Single Page Applications

Angular-Modules-and-routing-10-Single-page-applications

Single page applications work by leveraging the power of JavaScript and frameworks, such as Angular.

In SPAs, the browser sends an initial request and receives an almost empty HTML file.

What it contains however, are references to JavaScript files - the main engine of a single page app.

In traditional (single page) web applications, when the route is changed, the server responds with an entirely separate webpage.

In an SPA, when the **location is changed**, the **router** will load the corresponding component, which is already stored on the client.

Also, on the opposite side, a difference in the content will be represented in the URL.

This type of routing has many benefits, including:

- The resources for the app are loaded **only once**

- The state is maintainable across all pages

- We can use **browser history**

- Ð¢he user interface has increased response times

However, there is a minor downside - SPAs are not optimised for search engine discovery.

This means that our application may rank lower in search results, or appear on wrong queries.

This can become somewhat less of an issue if we apply the appropriate metatags and use SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) friendly URLs.
