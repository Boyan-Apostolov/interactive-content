# Summary
In this lesson we larned: 

- **For-loops** can use different **steps**
   - E.g. `i += 2` or `i *= 2` or `i = i * i`
- **Nested loops** are loops, placed **within another loop**
    - Nested **for loops**, could be used for processing data by rows and columns 
    - Nested **while loops**, are verry well applied for nested, repeating logic with exit conditions
