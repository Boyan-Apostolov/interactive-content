## In this lesson you learned:

- **For-loops** can use different **steps**
   - E.g. `i += 2` or `i *= 2` or `i = i * i`
- **Nested loops** are loops, placed **within another loop**

```js

while (condition) {
   
   for (variable initialization; condition; increment) {   
       
   }
}
```

- Nested **for loops**, could be used for processing data by rows and columns 

```js
for (variable initialization; condition; increment) {
  
  for (variable initialization; condition; increment) { 
   
  }
}
```
- Nested **while loops**, are verry well applied for nested, repeating logic with exit conditions 
```js
while (condition) {

  while (condition) {

  }
}
```
