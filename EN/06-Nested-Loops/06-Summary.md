# Summary
In this lesson you learnt that:

- **For-loops** can use different **steps**
   - E.g. `i += 2` or `i *= 2` or `i = i * i`
- **Nested loops** are loops, placed **within another loop**
    - Nested **for** loops, e.g. process data by rows and columns
    - Nested **while** loops, e.g. nested repeating logic with exit conditions
