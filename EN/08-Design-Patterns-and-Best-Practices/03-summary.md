# Summary

**In this lesson we learned:**
- Design patterns - proven approaches to common software problems that allow us to benefit from the knowledge and experience of other programmers who have over time come up with different patterns. Remember: **design patterns** are not concrete solutions and need to be implemented on a case by case basis after comparing their benefits and consequences from their use.   

- Categories of design patterns:
    - Creational - focus on object creation mechanisms.
    - Behavioral - improve communication between dissimilar objects.
    - Structural - deal with object and class composition.
