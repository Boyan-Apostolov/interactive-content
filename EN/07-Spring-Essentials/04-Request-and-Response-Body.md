# Request and Response Body

[slide hideTitle]
#  Request Body

The request body maps the **HttpRequest body** to a transfer or domain object, enabling automatic deserialization of the inbound **HttpRequest body** onto a Java object.

It is commonly used when creating RESTful API, where the request body has been generated by a script, and the response is in JSON or XML format. 

By using this annotation, the data will be automatically deserialized by the framework using a library name "Jackson". 

```java
@PostMapping("/students/add")
public ResponseEntity postController(
@RequestBody StudentAddBindingModel bindingModel){
    myService.add(bindingModel);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(HttpStatus.OK);
}
```
## Response Body

the response body tells a controller that the object returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the **HttpResponse object**.


```java
@GetMapping("/response")
@ResponseBody
public Exercise getLastEx() {
    // Get exercise from service
    return exercise;
}
```

The result of executing this action is:
