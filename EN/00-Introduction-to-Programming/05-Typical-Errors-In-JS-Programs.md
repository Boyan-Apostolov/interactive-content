Virtual Studio Code has a way to show us most of the basics errors we can make.

It **underlines** the wrong code that cannot be compiled.

Some of the basic common mistakes we can face:

- Mixing of **lowercase** and **uppercase** letters in syntax.

- Wrong Syntax.

- Missing quotes **"** or bracket **( or )**.

- Confusing **Addition** and **Concatenation**.

The "+" operator has two functionalities.

**Addition** is for numbers.

**Concatenation** is for strings.

- Confusing the **assignment** (=) and **equality** (==, ===) operators.

In JavaScript double equal and tripple equal sign are called comparison operators.
