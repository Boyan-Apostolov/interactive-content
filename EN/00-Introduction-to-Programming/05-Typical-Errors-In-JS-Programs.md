Visual Studio Code has a way to show us most of the basic errors we could make.

It **underlines** the wrong code that cannot be compiled.

Some of the common mistakes we can face are:

- Mixing of **lowercase** and **uppercase** letters in the syntax

- Wrong Syntax

- Missing quotes - `"` 

- A missing bracket - `(` or `)`

- Confusing the **Addition** and the **Concatenation** operations

The `+` operator has two functionalities.

**Addition** - for numbers.

**Concatenation** - for strings.

- Confusing the **assignment** (`=`) and the **equality** (`==`, `===`) operators

In JavaScript, the equality operators (`==`, `===`) are also called **comparison** operators.
