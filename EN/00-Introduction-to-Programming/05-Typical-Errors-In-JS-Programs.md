Visual Studio Code has a way to show us most of the basics errors we can make.

It **underlines** the wrong code that cannot be compiled.

Some of the basic common mistakes we can face:

- Mixing of **lowercase** and **uppercase** letters in syntax

- Wrong Syntax

- Missing quotes `"` or a bracket `(` or `)`

- Confusing **Addition** and **Concatenation**

The `+` operator has two functionalities.

**Addition** is for numbers.

**Concatenation** is for strings.

- Confusing the **assignment** (`=`) and **equality** (`==`, `===`) operators.

In JavaScript, double equal and triple equal signs are called comparison operators.
