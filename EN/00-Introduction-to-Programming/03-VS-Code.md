# Development Environments (IDE)

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-17-18-19-Integrated-Development-Environments-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

In order to program we need an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). 

An **Integrated Development Environment** (or IDE) is a combination of some traditional tools for creating software applications.

In the development environment we can **write code**, **compile**, and e**xecute programs**. 

Development environments usually integrate a **text editor**, a **programming language**, a **compiler** or an **interpreter** and a runtime environment for **executing programs**.

They also may contain a **debugger** for tracking the program and seeking out errors, and tools for **user interface design** or other utilities and add-ons. 

Development environments are convenient, because they integrate **everything necessary for the development** of a program, in some cases even without the need for external tools.

If we don't use an IDE, we would have to write the code in a **text editor**, compile it with a command on the console, run it with another console command and eventually include additional commands whenever needed, which is very time consuming. 

For programming with **JavaScript**, the most commonly used IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which is developed and distributed freely by Microsoft.

Some of the **popular** alternatives to Visual Studio Code are: 

- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

In this course, we are going to use **Visual Studio Code.** 

This is an example of how this IDE looks (the Visual Studio Code IDE for JavaScript):

# Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-20-21-22-Installing-NodeJS-and-Visual-Studio-Code-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

We need **Node.js** so that we can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.

* server-side JS runtime.

[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-3.png" /]

You can download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-nodejs-1.png" /]

Select your OS and go on with installing.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-nodejs-2.png" /]

Let's continue with the installation of the integrated environment **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**.

Installing later versions of Visual Studio Code should be very similar.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) is distributed freely by Microsoft.

The installation is typical for Windows with `[Next]`, `[Next]` and `[Finish]`.

The next lines describe in detail the steps for the installation of Visual Studio Code. 

After we download the installation file and start it, the following screen appears:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-1.png" /]

Press the `[Next]` button and you will see the screen bellow:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-2.png" /]

You can choose a destination location or leave the default one. Then press the `[Next]` button again.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-3.png" /]

Now we have to specify a name for the program folder which will be created in the Start Menu. 

The next step is to put check marks on the these tasks:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-4.png" /]

VS is now ready for installation. Press the `[Install]` button. Basically this is everything.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-5.png" /]

Installation of Visual Studio begins, and a screen like the one bellow will appear:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-6.png" /]

After Visual Studio is installed, an informative screen will appear. Press the `[Launch]` button to start it.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-7.png" /]

Upon **starting VS Code** the main view of Visual Studio Code is displayed. 

[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-8.png" /]

That's all. You are ready to work with Visual Studio Code.

# Development Environments: Desktop and Online

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-23-Development-Environments-Desktop-And-Online-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
* You can use an older version, but it is not recommended

Alternative IDE (online)

* JavaScript: directly use the browser console (press \[F12\] key)
* [C#](https://dotnetfiddle.net)
* [Java](https://compilejava.net)
* [Python](https://repl.it)

# What is Visual Studio Code

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-25-What-is-Visual-Studio-Code-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]


Visual Studio Code is open source-code editor.

It can be used with programming languages like: **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Go**, **Node.js** and many more.

Visual Studio Code allows users to open one or more directories. 

This allows it to operate as a **cross-language** editor for any programming language.

We can **extend** it via extensions, which are available through a central repository.

# Running VSC and Recommended Extensions

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-27-28-Running-VSC-and-recommended-extensions-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Visual Studio Code has many extensions that can make our working flow more pleasant.

- **Beautify** - Beautify formats files like HTML. The unformatted code in these files is converted into formatted.
 
We must enable this setting in the VS Code preferences tab and it will automatically format all the code.

- **ESLint** - ESLint analyze our JavaScript code and helps us to fix the errors.

- **JSHint** - JSHint enforce developers to use JavaScript coding convensions.

It helps to detect potential bugs in JavaScript code.

We use different extensions depending on what type of project we are working.

# Projects in VSC


[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/00.Introduction-to-Programming/EN/interactive-JS-PB-intorduction-to-programming-29-30-Projects-in-VSC-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The video above is showing how we can setup a basic project.

First, we need an empty folder. Then, let's drag the folder in to the Visual Studio Code.

The VSC will create a empty project for us.

Next, we must create a new file and name it.

The **extension** `.js` is important, since Visual Studio Code must know what type of language to use.

After we finished with writing our program, we must execute the code with **Note.js**.
