# What is a Responsive Design?​

A responsive design uses technologies like CSS media queries and flexible grids to ensure that a website is both easy to use and aesthetically pleasing on all screen sizes - like a laptop or a smartphone.

It should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

As a user transitions from their PC to a tablet or smartphone, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

The presentation layers must adjust according to the screen size of the different devices​.

Bootstrap supports many responsive design features.

It also provide a collection of pre-made templates for responsive UI elements.

# Include from a BootstrapCDN – JS​

When importing Bootstrap, make sure to include jQuery and Popper first:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>​

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>​

<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>​
```

Boostrap should be last, as it depends on the previous two.
