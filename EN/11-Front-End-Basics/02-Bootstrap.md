# What is a Responsive Design?​

Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. 

As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

The presentation layers must adjust according to the screen size of the different devices​.

# Include from a BootstrapCDN – JS​

Be sure to place jQuery and Popper first, as the Bootstrap code depends on them:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>​

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>​

<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>​
```
