# Seven Testing Principles

Hello. Today we will learn about **Unit Testing** and what are the **Seven Testing Principles**.

There are **fundamentals** testing principles which helps the testing teams to make the process of testing software more effective.

Lets see  what is the concept behind testing:

## 1.Testing is context depedent:

That means, that different kind of sites are tested differently.

For example: 

We can have different domains like **Banking**, **Marketing**, **Advertisement** and much more.

Each of these domains will be tested differently based on their **requirements**, **functions**, **different techniques** and etc...

The same goes for the software applications.

## 2.Exhaustive testing is impossible:

Thats mean simply we cannot test everything. 

We have almost **infinite** combinations of **input data**.

Instead of this, we can test a **few combinations** based on **priority** using different techniques.

Exhaustive testing will take unlimited efforts and most of those efforts are ineffective.

It is recommended to test input data using different methods like **Boundary Value Analysis** or **Equivalence Partitioning**.

## 3.Defect Clustering:

Most of the defects that are found during **pre-release testing** are related to a small numbers of module.

The main reason behind this is that the modules may be **too complex**. Coding related to such modules is complicated.

## 4.Early Testing:

The later a bug is found - the more it costs!

The **cost** involved fixing defects at the start, when the project is small is cheaper compared to those found during the later stages of testing.
