With MySQL, we can do much more than just store or retrieve information.

Knowing this, we can **manipulate** the data we have.

That is the purpose of **functions** - they are small pieces of code. 

Using them, we perform some **operations** and return the result from them.

In this lesson, we will review the four types of **built-in functions** provided in MySQL:

- **String** functions

- **Aggregate** functions

- **Date** functions

- **Math** functions

These are the **most commonly** used function types.
