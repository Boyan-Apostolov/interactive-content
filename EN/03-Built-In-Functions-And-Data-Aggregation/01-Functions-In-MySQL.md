With MySQL, we can do much more than simply store or retrieve data information.

Knowing this, we can **manipulate** the data we have.

**Functions** are small pieces of code. Using them we perform some **operations** and return the result from them.

Let us review the **built-in functions** provided in MySQL:

- **String** Functions

- **Aggregate** Functions

- **Date** Functions

- **Math** Functions

These are the **most common** functions that are used.
