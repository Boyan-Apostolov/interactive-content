## Description
Create a program that **manages users and emails** sent by users.

You need to keep information about their username and their sent emails.

The emails are **represented as strings**.

You will be **receiving lines with commands separated by** "->" **until you receive** the "Statistics" command.

There are **three possible commands**:
- "Add->\{username\}" 
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - **check if the username exists and if it does print** - "\{username\} is already registered"
    - if it doesn't exist, then add the user to the collection of users
- "Send->\{username\}->\{Email\}" 
    - add the \{Email\} to the \{username\}'s collection of sent emails
- "Delete->\{username\}"
    - delete the given user, if he exists
    - if the user doesnâ€™t exist, print "\{username\} not found!"
=======
    - **Check if the username exists and if it does print** - "\{username\} is already registered"
    - If it does not exist, then add the user to the collection of users
- "Send->\{username\}->\{Email\}" 
    - Add the \{Email\} to the \{username\}'s collection of sent emails
- "Delete->\{username\}"
    - Delete the given user, if he exists
    - If the user does not exist, print "\{username\} not found!"
>>>>>>> 36de252b4bccc9a87e2678b16676867c15c6f354

In the end, you have to **print the count of users**, **each user with their emails**. 

**Users** need to be **sorted in descending order** by the **count of emails they sent and then by their username in ascending order in the following format**:  

Users count: \{count\}

\{username\} 

 - \{Email1\}

 - \{Email2\}

 - \{EmailN\}

### Input

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The commands will be in the format described above.

### Output
- Print the collection in the format described above after the "Statistics" command
=======
- The commands will be in the format described above

### Output

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Comments
- First we receive our users
- Since they are not already in our collection, we add them
- Then they start sending emails and in the end we print the output in the described format
