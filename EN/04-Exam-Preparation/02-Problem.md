## Description
Create a program that keeps the whole information about some users, their usernames, and their emails.

The emails are represented as **strings**.

You will be receiving lines, containing commands that are separated by **"->"**, until you receive the "**Statistics**" command.

There are **three possible commands**:
- **"Add->\{username\}"** 
    - you should check if the username exists, and if it does, print out - **"\{username\} is already registered"**
    - if it does not exist, then you need to add the user to the collection of all users
- **"Send->\{username\}->\{Email\}"**
    - add the **\{Email\}** to the **\{username\}'s** collection of emails
- **"Delete->\{username\}"**
    - delete the given user, if such exists
    - if the user does not exist, print out - **"\{username\} not found!"**

In the end, you have to **print the count of all users** and **all users with their emails**. 

The **users** have to be sorted by the **count of their emails** in **descending** order, and then by their **username** in **ascending** order.

The output should be in the following format: 

Users count: \{count\}

\{username\} 

 - \{Email1\}

 - \{Email2\}

 - \{EmailN\}

### Input
- You will be receiving lines of input, until you receive the "**Statistics**" command
- The commands will be in the format described above

### Output
Print out the collection in the format described above after receiving the "**Statistics**" command.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Add->Mike | Users count: 2 |
| Add->George | George |
| Send->George->Hello World |  - Hello World |
| Send->George->Some random test mail |  - Some random test mail |
| Send->Mike->Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |  - It would be a pleasure |
| Send->George->It would be a pleasure | Mike |
| Send->Mike->Another random test mail |  - Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |
| Statistics |  - Another random test mail |

### Comments
- First, we receive the users
- Since they are not already in our collection, we add all of them
- Then, they start sending emails
- In the end, we print the expected output


### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Add->Mike | Mike is already registered |
| Add->George | Peter not found! |
| Send->George->Hello World | Users count: 1 |
| Send->George->Your loan is overdue | Mike |
| Add->Mike |  - Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |
| Send->Mike->Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |  - Another random test mail |
| Delete->Peter | |
| Send->George->I'm busy | |
| Send->Mike->Another random test mail | |
| Delete->George | |
| Statistics | |
