# Relational Databases

A relational database is a collection of tables with pre-defined relationships between them. 

The data is organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. 

Tables are used to hold information about the objects represented in the database. 

Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data.

The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object or entity. 

Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys. 

SQL or Structured Query Language is the primary interface used to communicate with Relational Databases.

# Non-Relational Databases

The main difference between relational and non-relational databases is how they store their information.

Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form. 

Non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents. 

A document can be highly detailed while containing a range of different types of information in different formats. 

This ability to organize various types of information side-by-side makes non-relational databases much more flexible than relational databases.

Non-relational databases often perform faster because a query does not have to view several tables in order to deliver an answer, as relational datasets often do. 

Non-relational databases are therefore ideal for storing data that may be changed frequently or for applications that handle many different kinds of data.

# Relational And Non-Relational Pros

Pros of a Relational Database:
- Data is easily structured into categories.
- They support **ACID** transactional consistency and support "joins".
- Relationships can be easily defined between data points.
- Limitless indexing.

Pros of a Non-Relational Database:
- Data is not confined to a structured group.
- You can perform functions that allow for greater flexibility.
- They scale out horizontally.
- High availability.
- Many are **open source**.

# What is BaaS?

Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend. 

BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on servers, such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, and push notifications (for mobile apps), as well as cloud storage and hosting.

There are two types of BaaS. One is Cloud BaaS and the other is Open source BaaS.
