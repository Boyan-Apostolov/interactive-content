# Exam Preparation: Shoe Shelf SPA

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/Exam_Preparation_ShoeShelf_Resourses.zip) **for this task.**

In this exam preparation, we are going to create a **Single Page Application** (SPA) using **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, **AJAX**, **REST** and **JSON** as well as utilizing a cloud-based backend (Firebase or Backendless).

Using libraries like **lit-html** and **page.js** is allowed but is **not obligatory**.

The app keeps **users** and **shoes.**

**Guests** should be able to register and log in.

Logged-in users should be able to view **all of the shoes**, **add new shoes**, **buy shoes**, see **details** about **shoes** and **logout**.

Logged-in users should also be able to **edit** or **delete** the **shoes that they have added.**

## Create a REST Service

Use any cloud-based database and create an application to keep your data on the cloud.

Create a collection called **shoes.**

Each shoes has a **name**, **price**, **imageUrl**, **description**, **brand**, **creator** and **people who have bought it.**

# HTML and CSS

You have been given the web design of the application as **HTML** \+ **CSS** files.

- Initially, all of the views and the forms are shown in the HTML files. 

Your application may **hide/show elements** using CSS (display: none) or **delete/reattach** all unneeded elements from and to the DOM, or just render the views it needs to displayed.

- You may render the views/forms/components with **JavaScript** or **lit-html**

- You are **allowed** to add **attributes** to any HTML element

## Important

Do not change the elements' **class names** and IDs.

Do not rename the form fields/links/IDs.

You may modify the **href attributes** of the links and add **actions/method attributes** to forms, to allow the use of a routing library.
