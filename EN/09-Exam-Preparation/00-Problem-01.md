Using libraries like  **lit-html** and **page.js** is allowed but is not obligatory.

The app keeps **users** and **shoes.**

**Guests** should be able to register and log in.

Logged\-in users should be able to view **all shoes**, **add shoes**, **buy shoes**, see **details** about a **shoes** and **logout**.

Logged-in users should also be able to **edit** or **delete** the **shoes they have added.**

Create a collection called **shoes.**

Each shoes has a **name**, **price**, **imageUrl**, **description**, **brand**, **creator** and **people bought it.**
