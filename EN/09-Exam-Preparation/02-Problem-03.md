# Navigation Bar and Home Page

## Navigation Bar
// Video: 04.1: Home page (Navigation bar). 

Implement a **NavBar** for the app: navigation links should change the current screen (view).


The navigation links should change the current page (view). 

**Guests** (un-authenticated visitors) can see the links to  the **Home Page**, **All Memes page**, as well as the links to the Login and Register pages. 

Authenticated users should be able to access the links to the **All Memes page**, the **Create Meme page**, the **My Profile page** and a link for the **Logout action**. 

The navbar should hold a user greeting: "**Welcome,** \{ **userâ€™s email address** \}"

User navigation example:
