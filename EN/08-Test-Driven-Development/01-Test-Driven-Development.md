# Test Driven Development

Hello. Today we will talk about the approach called **Test-Driven Development**.

There are test cases, that are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

Test cases are created to test our functionalities and if the tests fails then we need to write a new code that is **bug-free**.

The test-driven development method allows us go develop tests for every small functionalities.

We can consider it as process that relies on repetition of a very short development cycle.

Let's take a look at the sequence of steps that are followed:

- Write the test for the function that need to be implemented

- Write just enough code so the program will compile (there is no implementation, so the test will not pass)

- Write a small chunk of code to fit the test (by writing the failing test we ensure that our test is calling the correct code)

- Run all tests (the test will pass now)

- Refactor

- Repeat the process

Simply, we can say that a test-driven development is used to develop a tests before an actual code implementation.

Let's see some of the advantages using **TDD**:

- Test-Driven development encourage us to develop simple, clean and meaningful code.

- Another good use case is that developers may spend more time designing the boundary cases needing to be covered by this tests, compared to the traditional approach.

- TDD has more and higher test coverage of the code due to higher test density.
