# What is Polymorphism?

Hello there! Today, we will try to understand the nature of the forth OOP principle - The Polymorphism!

Polymorphism is one of the four OOP pillars in **object-oriented** languages.

It allows us to perform a single action in many different ways.

For example, lets say we have **superclass** called `Mammal` that has method called `makeSound`. 

**Subclasses** of our class Mammal could be Cats, Dogs, Pigs, Horses - And they also have their individual implementation for making sound.

Lets see that in code: 

``` java
class Mammal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}
```

``` java
class Cat extends Mammal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Meow Meow...");
  }
}
```

``` java
class Dog extends Mammal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Woof Woof!");
  }
}
```

Now we can go in our Main class and create our cat and dog objects and call `makeSound()` method on both of them.


``` java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Mammal animal = new Mammal();  
    Mammal myCat = new Cat(); 
    Mammal myDog = new Dog(); 
    animal.makeSound();
    myDog.makeSound();
    myCat.makeSound();
  }
}
```
