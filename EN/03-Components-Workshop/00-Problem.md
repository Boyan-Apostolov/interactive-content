[Download resources here!](https://mega.nz/file/Oc4BTa5B#kopKiHP4-KPlYK7si4ecujloS1PxIhVJG_ULMZmhpKo)

You will be provided with skeleton **HTML** and **CSS**. 

When starting the `index.html`, the following page will appear:

The application is a forum, where each registered user can create a theme or post a comment. 

For now, your task is to check the given skeleton, **HTML** and **CSS** files and split them into components, so each part can be reusable. 

Be careful when you structure the components.

# MongoDB

Before you start with creating a new project in Angular you need to install **MongoDB**.

You can find an installation guide [here](https://mega.nz/file/bMZC3ThT#1F--LRBifNwhKe_qg2eUgE9ZpV0u2tSx6u2jjpZO3cY)

After the successful installation your database will be empty, so you can load the provided data in the database as follows:

1. Use the provided folder named "forum" from resources.
2. You have to have mongod running on a separate system command line.
3. Open a new command line and in the console write the following command:
    - mongorestore -d forum C:\Users\Name\Desktop\forum

Note: C:\Users\Name\Desktop\forum â€“ replace it with the path of the folder "forum" in your computer!

On the console you will see something like this:

This is it! Now you can check if the **db** is in your **dbs** using the following commands:

# REST API

You are also provided with a REST API. Download it from [here](https://mega.nz/file/yN4k0RoS#pGmJUZli5wta8YIUC496T10bSv45sgbm62MeIX8vKmQ)

Inside the REST API folder you should first install the dependencies using the command "**npm install**". 

After that, type the command "**npm start**". 

In order to fetch the themes, you will have to make a GET request on `localhost:3000/api/themes`.

Here are the REST API endpoints specifications:

**Logged Unlogged User**

**NOTE: Because we have not covered authentication yet, you can hardcode it with a variable.**

Logged out users see the Login and the Register buttons or links.

# Implementation of the Main Section

After the back end is ready to use, you should fetch all themes and list them on the home page in the format provided in the skeleton.

The themes in the main section should be sorted by the subscribers in descending order.

Each theme should have a title, date of creation, the username of the creator and the count of the subscribers of the theme.

# Implementation of the Aside Section

In the Recent posts section, only the 5 latest posts must be shown! 

`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?limit=5`

The posts will be returned from the REST API **sorted by the time of creation**.

Each component should have a **title**, which is the title of the theme, a **username** of the user, whom the last comment in the theme belongs to, and the **time** the post was created.
