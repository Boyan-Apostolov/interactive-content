## In this lesson you learned:

- We can use both **Objects** and **Maps** to store **key-value** pairs

```js
let myMap = new Map([
  [3, 'three'],
  [2, 'two'],
  [1, 'one'],
]);
```

- In practice, **Objects** are used more often

```js
let car = {type:'Tesla', model:'X', color:'Blue'};
```

- **Maps** have advantages in some cases:
  - you may use **any data type** as **key**
  - they are **iterable**
  - they have a **size property**

## In the next lesson, you will learn:

- Strings
  - manipulating strings
  - building and modifying strings
