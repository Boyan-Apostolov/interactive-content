- We can use both **Objects** and **Maps** to store **key-value** pairs.
```js
let myMap = new Map([
  [3, 'three'],
  [2, 'two'],
  [1, 'one'],
]);
```
- In practice, **Objects** are used more often.

```js
let car = {type:"Tesla", model:"X", color:"Blue"};
```
- **Maps** have advantages in some cases:
  - You may use **any data type** as **key**.
  - They are **iterable**.
  - They have a **size property**.
