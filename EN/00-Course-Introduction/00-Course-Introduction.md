# Course introduction

Welcome to the Java OOP Advanced module!

As u all know, Java is **strong-typed OOP language**.

It implements all the **object-oriented concepts**.

Any programs that we write in Java must use the concept of class. Our `Main` method itself is included in a class main.

Classes are the basic building blocks of OOP paradigm.

Thats why its very important to understand the **four pillars** of **object-oriented programming**: 

- Encapsulation

- Inheritance

- Abstraction

- Polymorphism
