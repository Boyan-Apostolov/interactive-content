# Course introduction

## The four pillars of Object-Oriented programming.

Welcome to the Java OOP Advanced module!

**Here, we will take a look at what knowledge we will acquire after completing this module!**

As u all know, Java is a **strong-typed OOP language**.

It implements all the **object-oriented concepts**.

Any programs that we write in Java must use the concept of class. Our `Main` method itself is included in a main class.

Classes are the basic building blocks of the OOP paradigm.

That's why it is very important to understand the **four pillars** of **object-oriented programming**: 

- Encapsulation

- Inheritance

- Abstraction

- Polymorphism

## S.O.L.I.D Principles

We will extend our knowledge by learning the **first five object-oriented design principles**. The **S.O.L.I.D** principles.

**S.O.L.I.D** stands for:

- **S** - Single-responsiblity principle

- **O** - Open-closed principle

- **L** - Liskov substitution principle

- **I** - Interface segregation principle

- **D** - Dependency Inversion principle


Combined, these principles make it easy for a developer to create software that is easy to **maintain** and **extend**.

We will learn more about that later.

## Reflection

One particularly important subject of this module is **Reflection**.

Java Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, methods, and fields at **runtime**.

It is a powerful tool that can be very useful.

Is it **safe** to use Reflection? **When and how** we use Reflection? This is a small part of the things we will learn in this module.

We will extend our knowledge by learning how to use `@Annotations` in our projects.

## Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development

Is it possible to make a defect-free project? Is there a 100 % defect-free application? What are the defects and bugs? What they represent?

We will see why it is important to **test** our project, and how can **early testing** save us a lot of money, time and resources.

What framework we use for making more suitable tests for our project?

We will answer these and more questions in our lessons for Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development.

## Software Design Patterns

And last, but not least we will expand our knowledge learning about the best practices used by experienced developers.

As professional developers, we must know the concepts behind solving some of the popular coding problems.

These concepts often represents ideas, not a particular implementation.

Using the design patterns, we make our code less complicated, more reusable and maintainable.
