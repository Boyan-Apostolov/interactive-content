# Having Clause

We can use **HAVING** clause to summarize group records, whereas **WHERE** applies to individual records.

The **HAVING** clause operates on records returned by **GROUP BY**.

Unlike **HAVING**, the **WHERE** clause filters rows **before** the aggregation.

Any aggregated functions in the **HAVING** clause and in the **SELECT** statement are executed only one time.

Let see the following **example:**

**HAVING Syntax:**

``` java
SELECT e.`department_id`,
SUM(e.salary) AS 'TotalSalary'
FROM `employees` AS e
GROUP BY e.`department_id`
HAVING 'TotalSalary' < 25000;
```

**Output:**

| department_id | TotalSalary |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 227800,0000 |
| 6 | 318800,0000 |
| 7 | 2535100,0000 |
| 8 | 112100,0000 |
| 9 108100,0000 |
| ..... | ..... |
