# Stored Procedures

Stored procedures, also referred to as just "**Procedure**", is a **custom logic** that is removed from the **application server** and set to the **database server**.

A stored procedure **can accept parameters** as well as is able to **set up variables**.

Procedures are a useful tool that brings many benefits to our applications.

The main reason behind that is **because they are reducing the network traffic** and improves the **security of the database server**.

We can run procedures on any **platform that runs MySQL**, which makes them portable.

Also we can creates a **component from the data access routines**, separating it from the business logic.

Procedures can be **accessed through different programs** and APIs

Procedures can be used when there is a **repetitive task like looping**, **multiple statements**, and **no user interaction do** it with a single call of a stored procedure or the database server.

# Creating Stored Procedure

Now let us see how we can create one: 

```java
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_select_employees_by_seniority()            // The name of the stored procedure
BEGIN
  SELECT * 
  FROM employees                                                // The logic of the stored procedure
  WHERE ROUND((DATEDIFF(NOW(), hire_date) / 365.25)) < 15;
END $$

CALL usp_select_employees_by_seniority();                       // The calling of a procedure

DROP PROCEDURE usp_select_employees_by_seniority;               // Deleting the procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE usp_procedure_name                             // Creating a parameterized procedure
(parameter_1_name parameter_type,
parameter_2_name parameter_type,â€¦)
```

# Defining Parameterized Procedure

Example of parameterized procedure:

```java
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_select_employees_by_seniority(min_years_at_work INT)               // Defining the name of the procedure and its parameters.
BEGIN
  SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date,
    ROUND(DATEDIFF(NOW(),DATE(hire_date)) / 365.25,0) AS 'years'
  FROM employees
  WHERE ROUND(DATEDIFF(NOW(),DATE(hire_date)) / 365.25,0) > min_years_at_work           // Usage of parameters in the logic
  ORDER BY hire_date;
END $$
CALL usp_select_employees_by_seniority(15);
```

# Returning Values Using Output Parameters

We can also return values with a stored procedure.

```java
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_add_numbers
(first_number INT
second_number INT,
   OUT result INT)
BEGIN
   SET result = first_number + second_number;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
SET @answer=0;
CALL usp_add_numbers(5, 6,@answer);
SELECT @answer;
```
