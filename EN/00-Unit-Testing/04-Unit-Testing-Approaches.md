## Code First

This is a classical approach, where the functionality, is implemented and then the tests are written.

# Test-Driven Development

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/01.JS-Applications-Unit-Testing/EN/interactive-js-apps-unit-testing-20-test-driven-development-example-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The **Test First** approach suggests that we write the tests **before** the actual code. 

We can keep rerunning the tests. 

This way we will **always** know whether our code produces the expected results or not. 

In **Test-Driven Development** we follow these steps:
- Create a test list
- Pick a test
- Compose it 
- Compile and fail
- Write enough code to compile
- Run a test and fail
- Write code to pass the test 
- Remove duplication

# Why TDD is a better approach?

- TDD (Test Driven Development) helps find **issues** in an **early** stage of the project and avoid having to rework parts of out code 

- Writing code to **satisfy** certain conditions helps us acquire greater focus in the process

- If we create the tests before writing the code, usually they will be more **comprehensive**
