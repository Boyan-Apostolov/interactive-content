# Unit Testing Approaches

# Types of Unit Testing

## Code First

This is a classical approach. The code is written first then the tests.

## Test-Driven Development

Tests first approach.

In Test-Driven Development we follow these steps:
- Create a test list.
- Pick a test.
- Write a test.
- Compile and fail.
- Write enough code to compile.
- Run test and fail.
- Write code to past test.
- Remove duplication.

**Why TDD is a better approach?**

TDD helps find design issues early and thus avoids reworking.

Writing code to satisfy a test is a focused activity, with less chance of error.

Tests will be more comprehensive than if they are written after the code.
