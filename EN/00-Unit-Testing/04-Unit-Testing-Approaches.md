## Code First

This is a classical approach, where the functionality is implemented and then the tests are written.

# Test-Driven Development

Tests first approach means we write the tests before actual code. 

We can keep the tests running, and that way we will know does our code produces the expected result.

In Test-Driven Development we follow these steps:
- Create a test list
- Pick a test
- Write a test
- Compile and fail
- Write enough code to compile
- Run test and fail
- Write code to past test
- Remove duplication

# Why TDD is a better approach?

- TDD helps find issues in an early stage of the project and thus avoids reworking

- We avoid writing a code to satisfy the test, and our focus switch to writing better quality code

- Tests will be more comprehensive than if they are written after the code
