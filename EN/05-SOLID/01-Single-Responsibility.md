# Single Responsibility

A class should have **one**, and **only one**, reason to change.

This is the first **SOLID** principle - **Single Responsibility**.

One class should serve **only one purpose**.

This does not imply that each class should have only one method, but they should all **relate directly** to the **responsibility of the class**.

All the **methods and properties** should work towards the **same goal**.

When a class serves **multiple purposes or responsibilities**, it should be made into a **new class**.

Let's see the following example:

```java
// TODO search for appropriate example
```
