# Cube Model and Storage

## Cube Model

Each cube should have the following properties (for now it could be an ES6 class):

-   **id** - number
-   **name** - string
-   **description** - string 
-   **imageUrl** - string
-   **difficultyLevel** - number

## Storage 
Store the cubes inside **/config/database.json**

It is not a good practice, but as this is not the focus of this project, you can do it like this for now. In a later workshop, you will learn how to connect to and work with an actual database.
