There are many different types of templating engines, each with a distinct set of features:

## Frameworks  

- **React**
    * component-based JavaScript library
    * enables more flexibility
    * large community of developers

- **Vue**
    * combines the best features from React and Angular
    * focuses on simplicity and flexibility
    * highly customisable and extensible

- **Angular**
    * a JavaScript framework
    * much steeper learning curve
    * requires you to be familiar with TypeScript


## Standalone Packages

- **Handlebars**
    * logic\-less templates
    * easy access to global helpers and variables
    * requires server side JavaScript \(**Node.js**, for example\) to render on the server

- **Lit-html**
    * built on tagged template literals
    * allows rendering and partial updating of templates
    * compatible with all major browsers

In the remainder of this lesson, we will discuss lit-html in more depth.
