# Basic SQL Queries

## SQL Queries

We communicate with the database engine using SQL by writing queries which provide greater control and flexibility.

To create a database using SQL type in the following command:

```Java
CREATE DATABASE employees;  -   "Where 'employees' is the name of our newly created database".
```

SQL keywords are conventionally `capitalized` - in this case these are the words "**CREATE DATABASE**"
