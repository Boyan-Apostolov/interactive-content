# Data Defenition And Data Types

Today, we will talk about `Datatypes`.

There are several data types in MySQL:

- **Numeric**
- **String**
- **Date**

Let's start with **Numeric** data type:

The important thing you should know about **Numeric** data types is that they have a **range**!

Depending on the range they can be **Signed** and **Unsigned** except for the **BIT** type:

Here is an example for Signed and Unsigned **INT**:

`Signed`: Represents numbers both in the positive and negative range.

(min value: -2147483648, max value: 2147483647)

`Unsigned`: represents numbers only in the positive range.

(min value: 0, max value: 4294967295)

The following table shows the summary of numeric types in MySQL:
