# Problem: Forecaster

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/JS-Applications-Asynchronous-Programming-Homework-01.Forecaster.zip) **for this task.**

Create a program that **requests** a weather report **from a server** and **displays** it to the user.

**Use the skeleton from the provided resources.**

When the user writes the name of a location and clicks `Get Weather`, make a **GET** request to the server at address **"https://judgetests.firebaseio.com/locations.json"**.

The response will be an array of objects with the following structure: 

```js
{
  name: locationName,
  code: locationCode
}
```

Find the object, corresponding to the name that the user submitted in the input field with the ID "**location**" and use its **code** value to make **two more GET requests**:

- For current conditions, request to:

**"https://judgetests.firebaseio.com/forecast/today/**\{**code**\}**.json"**

The response from the server will be an object with the following structure:

```js
{
    name: locationName,
    forecast: {
        low: temp,
        high: temp,
        condition: condition
    }
}
```

- For a 3-day forecast, make a request to:

**"https://judgetests.firebaseio.com/forecast/upcoming/**\{**code**\}**.json"**

The response from the server will be an object with the following structure:

```js
{
    name: locationName,
    forecast: [{
        low: temp,
        high: temp,
        condition: condition
    }, …]
}
```

Use the information from these two objects to compose a forecast in HTML and insert it inside the page.

Note that the `<div`> with ID "**forecast**" must be set to **visible**. See the examples for details.

If an **error** occurs (the server does not respond or the location name cannot be found) or the data is not in the correct format, display `Error` in the **forecast section**.

Use the following codes for weather symbols:

- Sunny `&#x2600;` // ☀
- Partly sunny `&#x26C5;` // ⛅
- Overcast `&#x2601;` // ☁
- Rain `&#x2614;` // ☂
- Degrees `&#176;` // °

## Examples

When the app starts, the **forecast div** is **hidden**. 

When the user **enters a name** and **clicks** on the button **Get Weather**, the request is sent.

# Problem: Fisher Game

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/javascript/javascript-applications/JS-Applications-Asynchronous-Programming-Homework-02.Fisher-Game.zip) **for this task.**


- **angler**: **string** representing the name of the person who caught the fish

- **weight**: **floating-point number** representing the weight of the fish in kilograms

- **species**: **string** representing the name of the fish species

- **location**: **string** representing the location where the fish was caught

- **bait**: **string** representing the bait used to catch the fish

- **captureTime**: **integer number** representing the time needed to catch the fish in minutes

## HTML Template

**Use the skeleton from the provided resources.**

Attach handlers to the `[Load]`, `[Update]`, `[Delete]` and `[Add]` buttons, which make the appropriate **GET**, **PUT**, **DELETE** and **POST** requests.

You are given an example catch in the template to show you where and how to insert the catches.

Notice that the **div** containing the catch has an attribute **data-id** that should store the `_id` of the entry given by Kinvey.

Create the following REST services to access your data:

- **List All Catches**

  - Endpoint - **"https://fisher-game.firebaseio.com/catches.json"**
  - Method: **GET**
  - Returns (**Object of objects**)

- **Create a New Catch**

  - Endpoint: **"https://fisher-game.firebaseio.com/catches.json"**
  - Method: **POST**
  - Request body (JSON): `{"angler":"…", "weight":…, "species":"…", "location":"…", "bait":"…", "captureTime":…}`

- **Update a Catch**

  - Endpoint: **"https://fisher-game.firebaseio.com/catches/{catchId}.json"**
  - Method: **PUT**
  - Request body (JSON): `{"angler":"…", "weight":…, "species":"…", "location":"…", "bait":"…", "captureTime":…}`

- **Delete a Catch**

  - Endpoint: **"https://fisher-game.firebaseio.com/catches/{catchId}.json"**
  - Method: **DELETE**

- Pressing the `[Load]` button should **list all** catches.

- Pressing the `[Update]` button should send a **PUT** request, updating the catch in firebase.

- Pressing the `[Delete]` button should delete the catch both from firebase and from the page.

- Pressing the `[Add]` button should submit a new catch with the values of the inputs in the fieldset with `id="addFrom"`.
