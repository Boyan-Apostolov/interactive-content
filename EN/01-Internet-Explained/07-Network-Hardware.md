# Network Hardware

The **Internet** is a **global system** of interconnected **computers**.

This connection requires a lot of **hardware** and **maintenance**.

The **research** and **development** for that hardware is one of the most costly initiatives every year.

The better the hardware is, the **faster** and **more secure** an **Internet connection** is.

Here are some of the **physical components** that make up the Internet:

- Cables

- Routers

- Repeaters, Hubs, and Switches

- Bridges

- Gateways

- Network Interface Cards

# Cables and Routers

## Cables

Cables **connect** one piece of **hardware** to another.

There are several types of cables:

- Coaxial

- Twisted pair

- Optical fiber

**Coaxial** and **twisted-pair** cables typically connect machines within a **few meters** away from each other (usually within a building).

**Optical fiber** cabels are used for **long-range** connections, such as between **multiple cities**.

## Routers

**Routers** are reponsible for sending the **packets** between **networks**.

The most commonly known **routers** are those **small devices**, used in people's **houses** and **offices**.

However, there are **larger** and **more elaborate** **enterprise routers**, linking **larger networks** and sending data at a **faster rate**.

# Repeaters, Hubs, and Switches

**Repeaters, hubs, and switches** are **network-linking** devices, which can be part of a **singular component**.

- Repeaters - They receive a **signal** from a router and **resend** it
    * used when the distance that the data travels is too long

- Hub - A **hub** can link **Ethernet devices**. It has **several ports**, where each of them is plugged in
    * when a signal appears as an **input** in one of the ports, it is **output** in the other ports

- Switch - It links devices in a **computer network** and **forwards the information** through **packet switching**
    * remembers a device's **identity** and forwards only the data that **belongs to it**.

# Bridges and Gateways

## Bridges

**Bridges** are the **opposite** of **routers**.

While routers allow for **separate networks** to communicate, bridges link **two networks** into a **single one**.

When connected, data is sent from the **source network** to the **destined network**.

Bridges operate at the **second layer** of **OSI**.

## Gateways

**Gateways** use multiple protocols to connect **different networks**.

They take the role of a **Firewall**, **controlling** the **access** to the networks.

**Gateways** are also able to operate on **any** of the **OSI** layers.

## Comparison

| Bridges | Gateways |
| --- | --- |
| Transmit frames between two segments of a Local Area Network | They are protocol converters |
| Operate on the physical and data layers | Operate on all the layers |
| Check the frame's destination address | Enable the connection of two networks with different protocols |

# Network Interface Cards - NIC

The **Network Interface Card** is a piece of **hardware**, connecting the **computer** to a **network**.

It serves both as a **physical link** and **data link** layer.

The **NIC** allows the computer to communicate on the **LAN (Local Area Network)** and through the **Internet Protocol**.

It could be either **external** or **internal**.

External **NICs** are connected to a computer via **USB**.

Internal **NICs** could be connected through a **PCI** connector on the **motherboard** itself.

It is responsible for **transmitting** and **receiving** the **packets**.
