# Summary

## In this lesson you learned:

- The **Internet** consists of thousands of interconnected computer networks
    * establishes communication via protocols 
    * uses packets as a transfer unit 
 
- **Packets** are chunks of a larger file 
    * they carry essential information in their headers 
 
- An **IP address** is like a unique identification number 
    * the previous version of IP (IPv4) is out of unused combinations 
    * the new version IPv6 is being used for new IP addresses 
    * the DNS (Domain Name System) is used to resolve IP addresses to host names
 
- **TCP and UDP** are both transfer protocols 
    * TCP is more reliable as it performs more complex error checking and reorders packets
    * UDP is lightweight and fast but less secure than TCP 

- The **OSI model** splits a communication process into **seven** different **layers**
    * these layers range from the most low-level (physical layer) to the highest-level (application layer)

- **cables and routers** are the groundwork of the Internet
    * devices, such as hubs, switches, and repeaters control the data flow
    * a Network Interface Card allows a computer to access the Internet

## In the next lesson you will learn:

- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
    * a deeper dive into the concept of HTTP 
    * making requests and receiving responses 
    * how to work with Web Servers
