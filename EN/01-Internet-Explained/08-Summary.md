# Summary

[slide]

# In this lesson we learned:

**Internet**

- The internet consists of thousands of computer networks connected with each other

- Establishes communication via protocols

- Uses packets as a transfer unit

**Sending and Receiving Information**

- Packets are chunks of a larger file

- They carry important information in their headers

**Internet Protocol**

- An IP address is like a unique identification number

- The previous version of IP (IPv4) is out of more combinations

- The new version IPv6 is being used for new IP addresses

- The DNS is used to give an IP address a recognizable name

**Reliability and TCP**

- TCP and UDP are both transfer protocols

- TCP is more reliable as it performs more complex error checking and reorders packets

- UDP is lightweight, faster but less secure than TCP

**The OSI Model**

- The OSI model splits a communication process into 7 different layers

- These layers range from the most low-level (physical layer) to the highest-level (application layer)

**Network Hardware**

- The internet is built with cables and routers

- Devices such as hubs, switches, and repeaters can be used to control the data flow

- A Network Interface Card allows a computer to access the internet

## The topic of the next lesson is:

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**

- A deeper dive into the concept of HTTP

- Making requests and receiving responses

- Working with Web Servers
