# History

The Internet is a relatively **new** technology that has gone through **rapid development** in the most recent decades.

Very **different** from what it is today, the Internet marks its **beginning** in the **1960s**.

Back then, the basic idea was to **link** computers in a **network**, allowing for **data transfer** between them.

**TCP/IP** became a reality in the 70s. Computers were **linked independently** of each other.

The first **LANs** and **domains** were created in the 1980s.

The 90s were a pivotal point in Internet history. 

They marked the creation of **HTML**, **Java**, **the first Internet virus**, and major companies like **Google**, **Apple**, **Amazon**, and **eBay**.

At the beginning of the new century, the ** dot-com** bubble burst.

Some companies were erased while others (such as **Google**) became giants.

**Wireless access** became the new craze.

# Introduction

The **Internet**, at its core, is just a bunch of **cables**.

Buried **underground** or deep in the **oceans**, those cables **connect** many **different machines**.

These cables, usually **fiber-optic**, transfer data at very **high speeds**.

In recent years, however, there are other ways to **link devices**.

Some devices get linked via a **satellite signal** or a **phone network**.

Only the **Internet Service Provider** has access to the **fiber-optic cables**.

They then connect the users **indirectly**.

# What is a Network?

A **computer network** consists of **two** or **more** computers.

They could connect via **cable** or share a **wireless connection**.

A network of computers has some **protocols** to establish **communication** between them.

The **nodes** of a network typically have some form of **identification**.

When **connected** in a network, devices can **share** all kinds of **data**.

For example, a **laptop**, connected to a **PC** with a **USB cable**, makes up a **small network**.

They can share **images**, **audio**, or **video** files.

By contrast, **data centers** can be **thousands of devices**, sharing **tons of different information**.

# Networks and Internet

As mentioned earlier, a **network** consists of **many connected devices**.

The Internet consists of **thousands of networks** and therefore - **billions of devices**.

Those networks **communicate** through the **exchange** of **small data units** (**packets**).

The **TCP/IP** protocol defines their **communication**.

The Internet is a **decentralized** system.

A few **organizations** take care of the Internet's **maintenance** and **protocol updates**.

However, **no single organization** can claim **ownership** of the Internet.

The ability to instantly connect to anyone or find the information you need has changed the world in a **short timespan**.

Nowadays, there are **platforms** for anything - from social media applications to learning platforms.

Many **businesses are thriving** because of the **great advertising opportunities** the Internet provides.

However, this technology has its flaws too - **less room for privacy** and **cyber-security**.
