# History

The Internet is a relatively **new** technology that has gone through **rapid development** in the most recent decades.

Its history marks its **beginning** in the **1960s**, when Paul Baran, an **engineer**, proposes a distributed network based on data in message blocks.

Back then, the basic idea was to **link** a few computers in a **network**, and **transfer** data between them by splitting information into "**packets**"

**Packet-switching** is a way of grouping data into **packets**, allowing for a **reliable and more efficient** transfer.

The first **packet-switched** network, **ARPANET**, was **established** in the US in 1969 by Bob Taylor, an IBM employee, building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider.

The **Internet protocol suite** (TCP/IP) was **implemented** by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974.

The Internet Protocol (IP), part of the TCP/IP suite, is responsible for transferring packets between computers, based on a unique identifier called an "**IP address**".

The **Advanced Research Projects Agency Network** (ARPANET) was one of the first networks to **adopt** the **Internet Protocol**.

Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in **1989** to provide **Internet access** to the general public.

The 90s were a pivotal point in Internet history. 

They marked the creation of **HTML**, **Java**, **the first Internet virus**, and major companies like **Google**, **Apple**, **Amazon**, and **eBay**.

From 1997 to 2001, the "**dot-com**" speculative investment bubble **exploded**, with many companies going bankrupt after this financial crash.

Other companies, such as Google, became even more prominent market leaders in the **2000s**.

**Wireless access** became the new way to access the Internet in the 21st century, with Apple adopting the **Wi-Fi** standard in their iBook series of laptops.

# Introduction

The **Internet**, at its core, is a **network** of computers connected.

Using cables, buried **underground** or deep in the **oceans**, it **connects** many **different machines**.

These cables, usually **fiber-optic**, transfer data at very **high speeds** (up to **10 Gbps**).

In recent decades, however, other ways to **link devices** emerged.

Some devices connect to the internet via a **satellite signal** or a **cellular network**.

The most common way to **access** the Internet nowadays is via **Wi-Fi** connection.

Wi-Fi is also a **family** of **wireless networking** protocols.

It is based on the **802.11** standard, **part of the IEEE 802** set of technical standards.

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that **provides** the Internet to its customers.

Some service providers have additional services, such as hosting or domain name registration.

All data traffic is **transmitted** via the ISP.

# What is a Network?

A **network** is a **collection of computers** connected to each other via **cables** or a **wireless connection**.

A network of computers has some **protocols** to establish **communication** between them.

These protocols ensure that data is transferred in a **safe and reliable** way.

The **nodes** of a network typically have some form of **identification**, like a **MAC address** or an **IP address**.

These unique nodes are responsible for **handling** the **data** - they are the **endpoints** of the network.

When **connected** in a network, devices can **share** all kinds of **data**.

For example, a **laptop**, connected to a **PC** with a **USB cable**, makes up a **small network** of **two** devices.

They can share **images**, **audio**, or **video** files.

By contrast, **data centers** consists of **thousands of devices**, sharing **tons of different information**.

# Networks and Internet

As mentioned earlier, a **network** consists of **many connected devices**.

The Internet consists of **thousands of networks** and therefore - **billions of devices**.

Those networks **communicate** through the **exchange** of **small data units** (**packets**).

Packets are the **basic unit** of data transfer.

For instance, if we want to send an image to another device, we need to split the image into **chunks**.

The **TCP/IP** protocol defines their **communication**.

The Internet is a **decentralized** system.

A few **organizations** take care of the Internet's **maintenance** and **protocol updates**.

However, **no single organization** can claim **ownership** of the Internet.

The ability to instantly connect to anyone or find the information you need has changed the world in a **short timespan**.

Nowadays, there are **platforms** for anything - from social media applications to learning platforms.

Many **businesses are thriving** because of the **great advertising opportunities** the Internet provides.

However, this technology has its flaws too - **less room for privacy** and **cyber-security** loopholes that bad actors can exploit.
