# History

The Internet is a relatively **new** technology that has gone through **rapid development** in the most recent decades.

Its history marks its **beginning** in the **1960s**, with the development of the first electronic computer, the **IBM PC**.

Back then, the basic idea was to **link** computers in a **network**, allowing for **data transfer** between them.

The first **packet-switched** network, **ARPANET**, was **established** in the US in 1969 by Bob Taylor, an IBM employee, and David J. Watson, a Bell Labs employee.

**TCP/IP** became a reality in the 70s. Computers were **linked independently** of each other.

The **Advanced Research Projects Agency Network** (ARPANET) was one of the first networks to **adopt** the **Internet Protocol**.

The first **LANs** and **domains** were created in the 1980s.

LAN, short for **Local Area Network**, is a **collection of computers** connected to each other by a **network cable**.

A **domain** is a **name** that is **assigned** to a **LAN**.

The 90s were a pivotal point in Internet history. 

They marked the creation of **HTML**, **Java**, **the first Internet virus**, and major companies like **Google**, **Apple**, **Amazon**, and **eBay**.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the **dot-com** bubble burst.

Some companies were erased while others, such as **Google**, became giants.

**Wireless access** (Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity) became the normal way to access the Internet in the beginning of the 2010s.

# Introduction

The **Internet**, at its core, is a **network** of computers connected to each other.

Using cables, buried **underground** or deep in the **oceans**, it **connects** many **different machines**.

These cables, usually **fiber-optic**, transfer data at very **high speeds** (up to **10 Gbps**).

In recent years, however, there are other ways to **link devices**.

Some devices get linked via a **satellite signal** or a **phone network**.

The most common way to **access** the Internet is via **WAN** (**W**ireless **A**ccess **N**etwork).

WAN is a **broadcast** network that **transfers** data between **multiple** devices.

It is a **virtual** network, meaning that **no two devices** are connected to the same **router**.

Wi-Fi is a **family** of **wireless networking** protocols.

It is based on the **802.11** standard, **part of the IEEE 802** set of techincal standards.

The Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that **provides** the Internet to its customers.

All data traffic is **transmitted** via the ISP.

# What is a Network?

A **network** is a **collection of computers** connected to each other via **cables** or a **wireless connection**.

A network of computers has some **protocols** to establish **communication** between them.

These protocols ensure that data is transferred in a **safe and reliable** way.

The **nodes** of a network typically have some form of **identification**, like a **MAC address** or a **IP address**.

These unique nodes are responsible for **handling** the **data** - they are the **endpoints** of the network.

When **connected** in a network, devices can **share** all kinds of **data**.

For example, a **laptop**, connected to a **PC** with a **USB cable**, makes up a **small network** of **two** devices.

They can share **images**, **audio**, or **video** files.

By contrast, **data centers** constist of **thousands of devices**, sharing **tons of different information**.

# Networks and Internet

As mentioned earlier, a **network** consists of **many connected devices**.

The Internet consists of **thousands of networks** and therefore - **billions of devices**.

Those networks **communicate** through the **exchange** of **small data units** (**packets**).

Packets are the **basic unit** of data transfer.

For instance, if we want to send an image to another device, we need to split the image into **chunks**.

The **TCP/IP** protocol defines their **communication**.

The Internet is a **decentralized** system.

A few **organizations** take care of the Internet's **maintenance** and **protocol updates**.

However, **no single organization** can claim **ownership** of the Internet.

The ability to instantly connect to anyone or find the information you need has changed the world in a **short timespan**.

Nowadays, there are **platforms** for anything - from social media applications to learning platforms.

Many **businesses are thriving** because of the **great advertising opportunities** the Internet provides.

However, this technology has its flaws too - **less room for privacy** and **cyber-security**.
