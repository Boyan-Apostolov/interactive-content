Modern households consist of many devices.

Aside from the typical PCs, laptops, and tablets, there is a whole range of **smart home** accessories that are connected to the Internet.

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is made up of devices that connect to the internet and share data with each other.

This **interconnectivity** allows for new functionalities, such as controlling your home with **voice commands**, turning the **thermostat** on and off from your **mobile device**, or even **controlling** the temperature of your car.

It is estimated that by **2025**, there will be **21 billion** devices connected to the Internet of Things.

This number is expected to **double every five years**, and by 2030 - it will be 50 billion.

As major wireless carriers continue to roll out **5G networks**, the Internet will be able to reach more and more devices.

This will enable huge advancements in the fields of **healthcare, education, and home automation.**

In health care, for example, a **smartwatch** can be used to monitor the patient's body temperature and heart rate, and send this data to a tethered smartphone.

The smartphone can then create personalized **health reports**, and send them to the patient's doctor.

In the future, it will even be possible for a surgeon to perform a surgical procedure on a patient, without having to be in the operating room.

In education, **smart devices** can be used to monitor the student's attention span, and send this data to a teacher or counselor.

This will enable students with certain health conditions to be more **effective** in their studies.
