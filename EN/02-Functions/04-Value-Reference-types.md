**Value types** and **reference types** are the two main categories of JavaScript types.

## Value Types

A variable of a **value \(primitive data\) type** contains an **instance** of the type and holds their value directly.

With value types, each variable has **its own copy of the data**, and it is not possible for operations done on one variable to affect the other. 

When a value of a **primitive type** is assigned to **another variable of the same type**, a **copy** is made. 

When it is passed into a **method**, only a **copy of the primitive value** is passed. 

The called method **does not have access** to the original primitive value and therefore **cannot change it**. 

The called method can only change the **copied value**. 

Primitive data types are: `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `bigint` and `symbol`.

```js
i = 42;
ch = 'A';
result = true;
```

## Reference Types

**Reference type** variables hold Ð° reference (pointer, memory address) of the value itself. 

When a reference type variable is assigned to another reference type, **both will point to the same object. 

When an object is passed to a method, the called method can change the contents of the object passed to it but not the address of the object. 

Reference data types are: `object`, `Array` and `function`.

```js
let cars = ["NIO", "XPang", "Tesla"];
let obj = {firstName:"Maria", lastName:"Agarici"};
```
