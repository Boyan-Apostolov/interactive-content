If the book is already present on the shelf, ignore the command.

* Command `Take Book | {book name}`: Remove the book with the specified title (only if the book is on the shelf, otherwise ignore this command.)

* Command `Insert Book | {book name}`: Add a book at the end of the book collection. 

* Command `Check Book | {index}`: Print the name of the book, present at this index in the list.

If the index is invalid, ignore the command.
