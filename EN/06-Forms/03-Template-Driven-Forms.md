# Template-Driven Forms

Template-driven forms are not as scalable as Reactive forms. 

We use them when we want a very basic form requirement and logic that can be managed solely in the template.

- Provide visual feedback using special CSS classes.
- Display validation errors when needed.
- Use reference variables to share information.
