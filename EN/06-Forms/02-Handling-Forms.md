Forms in Angular allow us to work with user inputs like login, register, save, update, and many other data entry tasks.

There are two types of forms in Angular: **reactive forms** and **template-driven forms**. 

Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update.

They also provide a way to track changes.
