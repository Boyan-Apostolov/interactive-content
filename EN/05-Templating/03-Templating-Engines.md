A **templating engine** enables us to use static **template files** in our application.

**At runtime**, the template engine **replaces variables** in the template files with actual **values**.

Then, it **transforms** the **templates into HTML files**, which are **sent** to the client.

This approach makes it **easier** to design an HTML page.

There are many different types of templating engines, each with a distinct set of features:

- **Handlebars**
    - Logic\-less templates
    - Easy access to global helpers and variables
    - Requires server-side JavaScript \(**Node.js**, for example\) to render on the server

We will discuss Handlebars in a later video.

- **Mustache**
    - Clean syntax
    - Templates **have to be compiled on the server**
  
- **React**
    - A JavaScript Library
    - Enables more flexibility
    - Large community of developers

- **Angular**
    - A JavaScript Framework
    - Much steeper learning curve
    - Requires you to be familiar with TypeScript

- **Vue**
    - Combines the best features from React and Angular
    - Focuses on simplicity and flexibility
    - Highly customizable
